A consortium of six Atlanta me tropolitan area municipalities, 
our regional planning organization (Atlanta Regional Commission), our metropolitan tra nsit authority (MARTA), the 
Georgia Department of Trans portation, two universities 
(Georgia Institute of Technology and Oglethorpe University) several local citizens’ and n eighborhood groups, including the 
Atlanta Beltline and park, bike & trail advocates together 
propose to plan, implement, demonstrate and facilitate replication of a bold new approach  to a longstanding problem 
corridor:  Buford Highway (GA 13/US23) as it originates just 
east of the Lindbergh Center MARTA station in Atlanta & 
Fulton County, spans across DeKalb County, to the City of 
Duluth, Georgia, in Gwinnett County.
  
 
     
 
    The corridor is roughly 18 mile s long and connects six cities 
roughly paralleling the I-85 Inte rstate, serving an adjacent mu lti-
jurisdictional population of roughly 212,000 persons. 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The population of the municipality  of Atlanta is 450,000, of 
which 79,000 live in Buckhead around the Lindbergh MARTA station, near the SW end of Buford Highway (GA13 / US23).

ABSTRACT: “Traffic will kill Atlanta.”  
Having grown unbound by geographic limits – with no adjacent 
ocean, bay, lake, mountain range, broad river, or state line, 
Atlanta exemplifies the worst-case scenario of urban to 
suburban transportation-development sprawl  in the United 
States.   Buford Highway, our 6 to 7 lane, three c ounty multi-
jurisdictional state-route from  Midtown to Gwinnett County, is 
also our notorious example of dystopic land-use , a remnant of 
outdated and ineffective planning that failed to yield to the freight train of late 20
th century double-digit MSA growth.  That 
train left the station with no br akes when the population of ou r 
northeast suburban communities along the I-85 corridor, 
Gwinnett County, increased tenfold  since 1970, from 78,000 to 
over 860,000 today.  Similarly, Georgia, the fifteenth most populous state in 1970, now ranks ninth most populous. 
NAMING OUR CHALLENGES.    Decreasing our roadway 
congestion and providing effective alternative commute options for Atlanta’s north and northeas t MSA growth is critical to our  
f u t u r e  e c o n o m i c  v i t a l i t y .    T h e  n o r t h  s uburbs are counter-
weighted by the world’s busiest airport at the south-center of the 
I-285 perimeter, which decreased the desirability of surroundin g 
land for residential use.   Swa ths of existing neighborhoods we re 
annexed and cleared for Hartsfi eld-Jackson runway expansions, 
the last of which opened in 2006.  The modern era of urban development in Atlanta surged northward from the downtown 
Capitol area following Peachtree Street, annexing Buckhead in 
1952, sprouting a Midtown high-rise core and another one further north at Lenox, midway be tween the historic center and 
the north perimeter.  The last major new Atlanta arterial carve d 
from residential fabric was GA400, constructed from 1971-1993 
to relieve daily commute conges tion and connect the outside-
perimeter north municipal suburbs of Dunwoody, Roswell, and 
Alpharetta.  I-75, I-85, I -20 & I-285 are full right-of-way wi dth.  
HUB AND CONNECTION.  Lindbergh Center MARTA 
station near the southwest termi nus of Buford Highway is more 
than a transportati on hub and an area of d ense development, it’ s 
the geographic midpoint of living centers spread over the entir e 
metro area, often traversed when navigating from one signature “neighborhood in a forest” to another.    Atlanta’s tree-canopied 
neighborhoods include Buckhead, Decatur, Vinings, Smyrna, 
Mableton, West Paces Ferry, North Druid Hills, Tucker, 
Clarkston, Scottdale, Avondale Est ates, Panthersville, Gresham 
Park, Forest Park, College Park, East Point, Virginia Highland,  
Summerhill, West End, Bankhead, Ansley, as well as the six 
Fulton-DeKalb-Gwinnett County municipalities with their 
local governments  that support this proposal:  Atlanta, 
Brookhaven, Chamblee, Doravil le, Norcross and Duluth.     Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 3 of 32  HOPES FOR TECHNOLOGY.   Few innovations can match the 
power of electronic communication (now digital, wireless & ubiquitous) to disrupt or tr ansform society’s planned 
arrangements as do shifts in transportation technology .   F o r  
better or worse, transportation innovations typically affect la rge 
geographic areas and great numbers of people, often over generations and in unforeseen ways.  Though there remain many ways Atlanta’s interstates and arterials can be improved and 
optimized, there is little to suggest road-building will addres s the 
magnitude of current challenges or the additional trending grow th.   
Rather, we’re in a race to outsmart and overcome the consequences of past successes --- we’re seeing familiar approaches we’ve tapped before that will soon default to gridlo ck 
for several hours every workday.  But new innovations can 
sometimes leap over obsolete systems .   T h i n k  o f  t h e  g a m e -
changing adoption of cell-phones in developing countries that 
previously lacked telephone poles, overhead wires and analog switch exchanges --- practically overnight, underserved, neglected places found themselves “cutting edge,” even ahead of  
their neighbors and finding new opportunities afforded by the 
installation of relatively fe w cell-phone towers and wireless 
relays.  That’s the nature of the solution we intend here. 
Our proposal asserts that the tra nsportation corridor connectin g 
our municipalities along Buford Highway from Midtown Atlanta 
to Gwinnett is now “ripe” to leap ahead.  It has proven formida bly 
difficult to re-imagination for decades.  Its failed & ‘retro’ 
configuration is so out of date that it now qualifies as an 
underutilized asset, a potential m odel to convert and repurpose.    
This also suggests that a resolute, pragmatic approach to the 
challenges encountered along these 10-18 miles of previous car-centric planning will certainly offer a replicable roadmap to 
other mid-sized municipalities  facing the same intractable 
legacy.   
WHAT WENT WRONG?   There was a hidden, unintended lack 
of conviviality  in the urban/suburban planning & road-building 
spree that caught on here in the mid-20
th century.  Like many other 
cities in the US, we cheerfully ignored the economic externalit ies 
of too many parking lots, widened right-of-ways, dangerous 
pedestrian crossings, and other long-term macro- consequences of 
unbridled automobile-centered growth.  Next, we failed to imagine that our suburbs would one day be called on to house 
Americans who can’t afford one car, let alone two per family, but 
who nevertheless must travel to their jobs, schools, grocery st ores 
and everywhere else we need to go flexibly if we’re to going compete with our “human capit al” hitting on all cylinders. 
 
Proposed MARTA Transit-oriented Development adjacent to Chamble e Sta. 
WHAT CAN WE DO DIFFERENTLY?  Using ITS (Integrated 
Transportation System) technol ogy, our six collaborating 
municipalities can coordinate their efforts like never before.   
Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 4 of 32  We’ll implement a flexible, balanced approach using the latest 
environmentally clean, connected, rider-centric rapid transit &  
shared transportation technologies available.  The Bus Rapid 
Transit (BRT) model is well-pr oven now, worldwide.  But this 
simple improvement over traditional bus transit can be especial ly 
leveraged.   Combine it with ride and bike sharing, also now-matured system components.    We can enable these with insightful, transitional land-us e overlays and a sustainable, 
forward-looking means to finance new infrastructure where it’s 
needed.   Our plan will reverse environmental degradation, uncl og 
precious mobility, and remove hazards from the public way.   Further, we’ll set up optimal performance criteria to test, mea sure, 
manage, report, share and improve future planning.  Rather than  
borrow from the future, w e plan to invest in it. 
We see these goals as attainable while also activating streets 
with people-friendly amenities that improve quality-of-life 
and grant access to social amenities for everyone , including the 
youngest and oldest, disabled, and lower-income individuals and  
families for whom owning or operating a private automobile is not possible, or represents a wasteful investment of limited p e r s o n a l  f i n a n c e s .    O u r  p l a n n i n g  w ill recognize the emerging 
reality, that it’s not a failure of prosperity if there are few er cars 
than people in a dense urban/suburban context, especially if 
everyone is afforded reliable, comprehensive public 
t r a n s p o r t a t i o n  a l t e r n a t i v e s .    I n  s h o r t ,  w e ’ r e  a c knowledging a 
previously unthinkable question on the scale of a mid-size city :  
Why spend money to own a car that sits idle 95% of the time, an d 
will only get you stuck in traffic when you use it? Wouldn’t th at 
money be better spent on housing,  food, education, recreation a nd 
leisure, or saved for the future? Effective public transportation can save a typical household ov er 
$9,000 per year compared to private car ownership.    That savings 
alone justifies financing transp ortation-oriented development 
(TOD) as a social good and a stimulus to local economic vitalit y 
wherever it can be arranged. MARTA is already piloting TOD projects here on this principle: 
 Avondale Fact Sheet  
 Edgewood / Candler Park Fact Sheet  
 King Memorial Fact Sheet  
 Oakland City Station Engagement Report   
 
 TOD currently under construction at Avondale MARTA Station, De catur 
Buford Highway’s challenges ar e different than those facing 
MARTA along its rail lines, with their ready assets of large parking lots that can go underground (or under a podium), but the similarities are very real. Some of the expertise among 
MARTA and its competitively-selected developers will clearly 
transfer to road corridor redevelopment enabled by municipal economic development best-practices. 
Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 5 of 32  Atlanta will always need flexible, efficient, safe & comfortabl e 
vehicles (private and shared) to accommodate all the various kinds of travel, transport and commerce, but continuing to buil d 
dense, sprawling or highly-util ized destinations and expect the se 
to function smoothly if everyone  has their own vehicle to operate 
and park on a two-dimensional c onventional roadway is to deny 
the obvious: It won’t work. As the  IT and application developer s 
say, “It doesn’t scale.”  And we end up horribly wasting time, 
resources and space.    Worst of all, its real cause is a failure of 
imagination, which is not an epitaph Atlanta is going to endors e.   
We make history here in Atlanta.    We’re ready to do it again. 
ATLANTA’S EXTRAORDI NARY COLLABORATION 
CLIMATE:  “We love B uford Highway!” 
Fortunately for Atlanta in 2016, renewed 
prosperity after the recession of 2008 has re-
awakened civic pride and awareness of the 
possibility of transformation through innovation collaboration and more activat ed streets and neighborhoods.  
The climate here in 2016 is cer tainly reminiscent of the 
extraordinary changes of the economic “boomlet” associated with hosting the Olympic Games twenty years ago.  
Intergovernmental cooperation at t he time facilitated athletic 
venues and travel by spectators across multiple jurisdictions, successfully re-activated Atlanta’ s lethargic downtown business  
core, leaving us Centennial Park and an Olympic Stadium which then became the Braves’ Turner Field.  The Olympics also 
ushered a wave of international immigration and stimulated 
stagnated in-town residential redevelopment.  Today the region’s citizens, municipalities, planners, and an entire ecosystem of citizen activists, business, government as well as  the “creative class” of designers, architects, engineers and 
visionary entrepreneurs are c lamoring for more innovative 
collaborations to improve quality of life in the city.   Recent ly, 
Atlanta is suggesting it’s ready to become the “Silicon Valley of 
the South,” too. 
Unexpectedly, Buford 
Highway emerged 
heroic in the civic 
conscience – its diversity, its dynamic and eclectic businesses, busy 
restaurants, Asian and 
eastern European 
importers and international food emporia are regarded as civic treasures, despite the repetitive and relative ugliness of its countless non-descript strip ma lls, repurposed fast-food outlet s, 
and chain-link fronted used car dealerships.  There’s a “Wild 
West” aspect to this corridor tha t inspires us and is suited to  
Atlanta’s epic and uneven municipal history.  Despite its ills,  
there’s affordable housing here along Buford Highway and a concentration of contributing et hnicities that maintain aspects  of 
their respective cultures while assimilating through commerce, 
education and local politics that’s an ideal of American life.  
The urgent and necessary international gravity of the Centers f or 
Disease Control headquarters is here.  But the practical idea t hat 
“small government can work” is also alive and well in each of 
the six cities along the corrido r.  There’s still unincorporate d 
DeKalb County land just south of Chamblee and Doraville, not to mention a major airport full of private and charter small 
Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 6 of 32  aircraft that abuts the 
highway.  Plaza Fiesta shopping center offers 
140 independent vendors 
under one 350,000 roof, modeled on a Mexican outdoor stall market. 
 
Everyone here knows something about Buford Highway (for 
better or worse) and there’s a se nse we collectively want to se e 
it succeed, to mature, to shed its negatives and become a bette r 
place to live, work and play, but also that it deserves to retain 
aspects of its present character .    It would be a shame if it lost 
its diversity, its affordability, or the “place-making” that’s been 
the unexpected blessing of its notoriety as one of the 
sprawlingest business districts in the United States.   Atlanta  is 
of course also the famous birthplace of Rev. Martin Luther King , 
whose dream for America includ ed “the black, white, yellow, 
red and brown” of the world coming together in harmony.    If 
there is a place in Atlanta where that dream is most evidently true, it’s certainly Buford Highway. 
 
“Help us to walk together, pray together, sing together, and 
live together until that day when all God's children -- Black, 
White, Red, Brown and Yello w -- will rejoice in one 
common band of humanity in the reign of our Lord and of our God, we pray. Amen .”  ---  Martin Luther King, Jr. 
 PLANNING, TRANSPORTATION, SOCIAL & 
TECHNICAL SUCCESSES & FAILURES IN GEORGIA  
(Atlanta’s remarkable journey shapes its readiness to lead.) 
Atlanta and Georgia are standout s in the unfolding history of 
business, technology, planning and innovation, with numerous 
examples of early adoption, unint ended consequences, and high 
stakes reversals of fortune. A quick overview hints at Georgia’ s 
long-standing knack for pioneer ing, resisting or otherwise 
embracing transformative ideas and trends, for better or worse.  
In 2016, it’s a city willing to learn, change, lead and share.    
The land now encompassed by Georgia was of course originally 
settled and occupied by Native Americans. These Americans 
first encountered European culture when explorers from Spain arrived around 1520.  The first r ecorded Catholic Mass in North  
America was performed at a Spanish settlement in 1526 on the 
coast of what is now Georgia.   With their trans-Atlantic crossings though, Europeans in advertently introduced new 
diseases all over the western hemisphere, unfortunately Smallpox (the Variola virus), which decimated native 
populations.  Outright conflicts  between new and original 
inhabitants and between competi ng colonial powers, who drew 
in natives as proxies and allies also exacted a heavy price.  T he 
English violently drove the Spanish and their native allies fro m 
the contested coastal region here 299 years ago, in 1717.  
Next page  shows a high-level schedule of the vision for a 
reinvented Buford Highway corridor, leveraging USDOT’s Smart 
City Challenge and technical assistance into a successful proje ct 
called “Lindy.”  The diagram effe ctively exhibits LINDY’s “Prog ram 
Management approach” at this early conceptual stage.

300 to 200 years ago.   The English colony of Georgia  (named 
after then King of England, George II) was founded at the site of the present day port of Sav annah in 1733, its charter secure d 
by Parliament and member James Oglethorpe.  Oglethorpe 
arrived on the first ship carrying colonists to serve as its Governor.   The structure of the  Charter and its subsequent lan d   
grants to colonists were innovatively designed to balance town 
& agrarian land use .   English planners associated unregulated 
urban land use with the disintegr ation of society.  Their opini on 
arose from observations of fast -growing municipalities back in 
Europe, at the time experienci ng disruption from country-to-cit y 
migration linked to early agric ultural consolidation and the

opportunities of new industries a nd finance.  England was also 
suffering the effects of a prodi gious public health crisis from  
alcohol (“Gin”) drinking, esp ecially from 1730 to 1757 when 
economics favored the production of extremely cheap distilled 
spirits. The Georgia Colony ch arter balanced land use by 
associating 50-acre rural farms each with an in-town lot for a 
house and garden.    E v e r y  c o l o n i s t  f a m i l y  w a s  e x p e c t e d  t o  
support itself by farming.  A final Spanish military invasion 
from Florida was repulsed by English settlers in 1742.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Early Georgia was open to imm igration.  Colonists included 
Scottish pioneers and English artisans/tradesmen, religious refugees from Germany, Switzerland, France and Austria, as 
well as Jews leaving Europe.  Governor Oglethorpe was a 
humanitarian visionary who outla wed slavery in the colony, but 
after his departure back to England in 1743, the remaining colonists overturned his ban.   Colonists began importing slaves  
from Africa in large numbers, a practice which continued legall y 
under English law and was unchanged by the assertion of U.S. 
independence during the American Revolution (1775-1783) until the importation of slaves was made illegal in 1808. 
200 to 100 years ago.    Slave smuggling  into Georgia continued 
illegally to support the hugely p rofitable cotton plantation 
economy until the aboliti on of slavery by the 13
th Constitutional 
Amendment in 1865 at the close of the American Civil War (1861-1865.)    In the meantime, the industrial revolution  had 
begun:  steel, steam engines, and labor-saving machines of all 
kinds began appearing and changing old ways of life.  The 
invention of the cotton gin served to triple  cotton production for 
the textile industry between 1830 and 1850.    Slavery increased 
accordingly, and the South became an agricultural power-house, producing 2/3rds of the world’s cotton and earning impressive 
fortunes for investors to spend developing their towns, factori es, 
plantations, ports and rail roads, and to import goods.     
Atlanta was initially founded as “Terminus” around 1840, 
purposefully placed to serve as a rail transportation hub.   
Settlement grew quickly around ra ilroad yards, warehouses and 
merchant storefronts.  Over its first two decades Atlanta becam e 
a major center of industrial operations.  As such it was a top strategic asset to the Confederacy when Georgia seceded from Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 9 of 32  the Union and hostilities began between the North and South in 
1861. Atlanta’s importance to the South only increased after th e 
fall and occupation of New Orleans by Union forces in spring 
1862.  Atlanta factories ramped up to manufacture railroad cars , 
revolvers, cannon, knives, saddles and spurs, buttons and belt buckles, tents and canteens.  A naval munitions factory was salvaged from New Orleans and moved to Atlanta, which turned out 7”, 100lb artillery shells.   Atlanta’s steel ro lling mill made 
the 3” thick plating used to armor-clad the steam-powered 
warship CSS Virginia (also known as the Merrimack) which easily sank and defeated the first two wooden warships it encountered (firing 7” shells at close range.) In a one-day nav al 
battle in March 1862, with only two Confederate casualties compared to 400 Union sailors lost, this military tech innovati on 
rendered all but two other warsh ips in the world obsolete and 
vulnerable.   A world-wide naval  armored gunship race ensued 
over the next 80 years, which the U.S. ultimately won. 
DESTRUCTION AND REBIRTH.   By 1863, the Union 
understood it needed to knock Atla nta out of the war.  After th e 
city fell to siege and attack by forces under command of Genera l 
William T. Sherman in the summer of 1864, the Northern army occupied Atlanta for two months.  Realizing the spirit of the Confederacy was still not broken,  Sherman conceived a plan to 
drive home the point that the South could no longer hope to win  
the war.   He pr oposed a destructive “March to the Sea” across 
Georgia that would cripple the resilient deep-south and render it 
incapable of feeding, clothing, or supplying its army still in the 
field.  President Lincoln and his top general Ulysses Grant 
agreed to Sherman’s plan.   That November, Sherman burned 
Atlanta’s remaining assets to the ground, spared only several hospitals and churches, and departed for Savannah with some 
60,000 troops.  He kept no rear supply line, saw no significant  
opposition in front of him, and issued orders that amounted to 
“Total War” against the rural ci vilian population, to confiscat e 
or destroy property, valuables o r crops in a wide sweep across 
the state. 
General Sherman’s memoir recalled the scene: 
“We rode out of Atlanta by the Decatur road, filled by the 
marching troops and wagons of the Fourteenth Corps; and 
reaching the hill, just outside of the old rebel works, we 
naturally paused to look bac k upon the scenes of our past 
battles. We stood upon the very ground whereon was fought 
the bloody battle of July 22d, and could see the copse of wood 
where McPherson fell. Behind us lay Atlanta, smoldering and 
in ruins, the black smoke rising high in air, and hanging like 
a pall over the ruined city.”         — William T. Sherman 
The image of a defeated city, re building itself without bittern ess 
or self-pity after the war, is one of Atlanta’s enduring values , a 
commitment to reinvention and overcoming adversity that ushered it to the modern era of the past 100 years.    The motto 
on the city seal adopted in 1867 is Resurgens, Latin for “Risin g” 
(Resurrection.)  The seal shows the mythic 
Phoenix bird, ascending from fire and the ashes of its predecessor.   Reconstruction was fast and effective.  In 1868 Atlanta was made the Capital of G e o r g i a .    B y  1880 Atlanta was the 
largest city in the state, population 
37,000.

Atlanta’s streetcars (horse dr awn at first) began operating on 
Peachtree Street in 1871.  Elect rified trollies appeared in 188 9. 
Beginning shortly after the Civil  War, Georgia saw the founding  
of its historic black colleges, Morehouse, Spellman, Clark, and  
Atlanta University which advanced black leadership, offered 
master degree programs, training ministers, engineers, doctors & lawyers who formed a stable black middle class, despite re-segregation and the advent of discriminatory “Jim Crow” laws. Jim Crow appeared after the R econstruction period ended and 
Federal troops left the south in 1877.    Their departure ended 
enforcement of 14
th Amendment suffrage for former slaves and 
abandonment of equal protection for all regardless of race.    Besides the betrayal of Rec onstruction, there were other 
setbacks to civil society along the way, including an infamous riot in 1906 amid racial tensions incited by newspapers in the 
lead-up to that year’s gubernatorial election.   A mob of white s 
killed at least 25 black citizens.  Historians credit the after math 
of the internationally-reporte d event as inducing a more 
aggressive approach to the strugg le for Civil Rights in the bla ck 
community over the long run, rather than the more 
accommodating strategies favored by previous African- 
American leaders, such as Booker T. Washington.  Relations remained tense for another six decades.
 
The Georgia Institute of Technology was founded in 1885 by the 
General Assembly and endowed with 5 acres at 10th St., which 
was at the time the City’s northern limit.    Tech’s night scho ol 
was spun off as Georgia State University in 1931.    
100 to 50 Years Ago.   Originally chartered in 1834 and named 
after the English founder of the  Georgia colony, Oglethorpe 
College was shut down by the Civi l War and was eventually re-
chartered as a non-denominational institution in 1913. Construction of its new cam pus in Brookhaven was begun in 
1915.    The sc hool changed its name to Oglethorpe University 
in the late 1960’s.  A DeKalb C ounty public charter high school   
also operates embedded in the college campus today.  
1923-1927.  “Lucky Lindy’s” transportation connection to 
Georgia.    Americus, Georgia was home to a training base for 
US pilots during WWI.   In late April 1923, twenty-one year-old  
Charles Lindbergh arrived to pur chase his first airplane from a n 
army surplus trader out of M acon.  Having saved his money 
working as a “barnstorming” daredevil (an airshow wing-walker 
Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 11 of 32  and parachutist) he selected a C urtiss JN-4 ""Jenny"" biplane for  
$500, new in a crate, w hich was assembled f or him.   L indbergh 
was adept enough to taxi the new plane himself and attempt take -
off, but a wind gust dipped his wing to the ground and he abort ed 
his first flight attempt.   A pilot watching from a hanger offe red 
to take him up instead.   For several hours, the two practiced take-offs and landings together.    Later that day, Charles fle w 
on his own, his first solo flight in life was over Georgia.  A week 
later, with 20 hours’ flight e xpeience, he took-off for 
Montgomery to start his career as a barnstormer and airmail pilot. Four years later, on May 21, 1927, 33-1/2 hours out of New York, he circled the Eiffel Tower in Paris and landed at Le  
Bourget Field, completing a 3, 610-mile non-stop flight across 
the Atlantic, claiming the Or teig Prize worth $25,000.00.

air transportation, inspired people and awakened imaginative possibilities.  William Hartsfield (an Atlanta City Councilman,  
amateur aviator, and future Ma yor for whom Atlanta’s airport 
was later named) was among the businesspeople and politicians 
who arranged for Lindbergh to visit, exhibit his aircraft, and give 
a speech.   Arguably the most famous person in the world at the  
time, Lindbergh was awarded honor s everywhere he went.   His 
great fortune inspired a nickna me “Lucky Lindy.”   A dance step  
was named after him in Harlem, “The Lindy Hop” which swept 
around the world during the 1930’s with American Swing Jazz.   
A world-wide wave of enthusiasm for American culture erupted, exemplified by Lindbergh’s da ring, technological know-how 
and initiative.  In 1930, Li ndbergh leveraged his fame to 
convince New York financier Daniel Guggenheim to fund Robert Goddard's rocket research.   Goddard’s experiments 
become the basis of jet-assisted take-off, US military missiles  
and eventually the NASA space program.  Atlanta renamed Mayson Avenue as Lindbergh Driv e in 1927, coincidentally the 
site of a future MARTA stop. 
Jimmy Carter was born in Plains, Georgia in 1924. 
Sam Massell, Atlanta’s first Je wish Mayor, was born here in 
Atlanta in 1927.  His administra tion from 1970-1974 is credited  
with establishing MARTA.   Massell’s sec ond (perhaps fourth) 
career included directing the Bu ckhead Coalition, a business 
association dedicated to the nor thern development area, real 
estate, tourism and transportati on, among his other interests.  
Massell is 88 in 2016, still making Atlanta-boosting speeches! 
Maynard Jackson, Atlanta’s first black mayor (and the first bla ck 
mayor of any large southern city) was born in 1938. Jackson graduated from Morehouse in 1956, entered politics, 
Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 12 of 32  
The MARTA Rail System (Control Panel view, 2005.) unsuccessfully ran for US Senate at age 30, but won a position 
as Vice Mayor 1970-1974 before unseating Sam Massell. Jackson was elected to serve three separate 4-year mayoral term s 
beginning in 1974-1982, punctuated by the two terms of Mayor 
Andrew Young, then Jackson again from 1990-1994.    Jackson 
is credited with modernizing a nd expanding Atlanta’s airport to  
astounding economic success.   After his death in 2003 the airport was partly renamed after him as “Hartsfield-Jackson” in  
his honor.  While in office Jackson opposed  DOT plans to place 
several more interstate c onnectors through in-town 
neighborhoods, during a period of citizen “freeway revolts” beginning in 1966 and continuing up until the time of the Olympic Games’ downt own revitalization su ccess and changes.  
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) was founded in 1946.   
It functions as the leading nati onal public health institute of  the 
United States, with headquarters in DeKalb County, including a 
major facility on Buford Highway, designated as its Chamblee 
Campus, just northeast of Peachtree DeKalb Airport. 
In 1952, the City of Atlanta annexed its uptown Buckhead 
suburb, which over time became the City’s third most densely urbanized district after downt own and midtown.  Lenox Square 
mall was built in 1959, continuing Atlanta’s northward growth 
surge.   
In the 1960s, Atlanta was a critic al organizing center of the U S 
Civil Rights Movement.   Martin Luther King, Jr. and students 
from Atlanta's historically black  colleges and universities pla yed 
various leadership roles.   Early sit-ins at the segregated lun ch 
counters of several Atlanta dep artment stores, including the Walgreen’s in Lenox Mall, led to the arrest of Dr. King and 
several students. This drew attention from the national media. 
In 1965, the Georgia General Assembly created the 
Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA.) MARTA was to provide rapid transit for the five largest metro counties: DeKalb, Fulton, Clayton, Gwinnett, and Cobb, but Cobb failed to join by referendum. In 1971, Fulton and DeKalb 
Counties passed a 1% sales tax i ncrease to pay for operations.  
In 1972, the agency bought the e xisting, bus-only Atlanta 
Transit Company.  Construction be gan on the rapid rail system 
in 1975, and service commenced June 30, 1979, running east-west from Georgia State University downtown to Avondale. The 
Five Points downtown hub opened later that year. By 1984 the 
North-South line had been extended to reach from Brookhaven to Lakewood/Fort McPherson. In 1988 the line was extended into inside the terminal at Hartsfield-Jackson Airport. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 13 of 32  50 Years Ago.  Georgia State Senator Jimmy Carter (1963-
1967) became Governor of Georgia in 1971-1975 and 39th 
President of the US from 1977-1981.     Carter worked in the 
Navy’s nuclear program before re signing his commission to start  
an agriculture business and enter politics.   Carter was forwar d-
looking about the confluence of t ransportation, environmental, 
economic vitality and housing issues.    I n  1 9 7 9  h e  i s s u e d  a  
statement along with an executive order to his cabinet agencies .   
Not surprisingly, all of his directives remain applicable, some  37 
years later: 
“… transportation systems can greatly affect, for better or wor se, our 
nation's environment, our utilizat ion of energy, and our urban areas. It 
is my Administration's policy to enhance environmental protecti on, 
energy conservation, and urban revitalization … that the nation 's 
transportation system must prov ide greater support for these na tional 
goals. 
I fully support the reorientation of urban transportation progr ams and 
projects to meet energy and urban goals and to improve overall 
environmental quality. I am direct ing you to act immediately to  assure 
that: 
 transportation funds are used to promote energy conservation 
through such energy saving features as special lanes for carpoo ls, 
vanpools, and transit vehicles, and that encouragement be given  
to applying funds to public transportation projects; 
 careful review is given to any t ransportation proposals which 
would encourage urban sprawl—one of the major causes of our 
high energy consumption-or which would tend to attract jobs out  
of our urban centers; 
 consideration is given to the im provement and rehabilitation o f 
existing facilities and the use of non-construction methods as 
alternatives to constructing new facilities;  major transportation projects are utilized as a positive facto r for 
improving the urban economy and attracting jobs to the nation's  
urban cores;  
 …and that environmental commitments we make in approving 
transportation projects are carried out when the projects are b uilt.” 
Notice how President C arter’s vision aligns with the framework 
of USDOT’s 2016 Smart City Chall enge!  We reiterate here the 
concept of the proposed Buford Highway Bus Rapid Transit, to 
implement systems and innovations  that will address challenges 
associated with the project area, measurably demonstrating 
success at USDOT’s suggested goa ls, with replicab le result: 
 Reduce traffic congestion 
 Improve traveler safety, especially for pedestrians 
 Protect the environment and conserve energy  
 Connect underserved communities 
 Support economic vitality 
 Mitigate climate change 
 Improve the efficiency of city services delivery 
 Leverage existing transp ortation infrastructure 
 Optimize citizen participation  
 Open data to spur related innovation 
 Implement self-funding mechanism(s) to enable second-
round cost sharing during ope rational implementation. 
Details of the above goals are dis cussed at the conceptual leve l 
in this application, under the a ppropriate headings and respons e 
sections that follow.    Meanwhile, stakeholder readiness along  
the Buford Highway corridor to implement transportation 
improvements and transportation-oriented redevelopment is 
strongly evident in documents such as the 2014 Economic Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 14 of 32  Development Study commissione d by the City of Brookhaven.  
After a 1-year comprehensive t echnical study, the consultants 
summarized some long-term recommendations in a section titled  
Redevelopment and Economic Opportunities as follows: 
“Over the next five to ten y ears, the City of Brookhaven 
should work collaboratively with key Buford Highway Corridor property owners and with developers attracted 
by the potential for revitalization to facilitate 
redevelopment of the multiple parcels identified in this report. These redevelopment ventures will capture the residential, hotel, and retail/commercial opportunities identified in the market analysis. 
These redevelopment opport unities will establish a 
positive entryway to Brookhaven from I-85 at the North Druid Hills/Buford Highway intersection. They will 
benefit from and closely relate to the proposed North 
Fork Greenway Trail. They will encourage rejuvenation of major commercial developments such as Corporate Square and Northeast Plaza in part through establishing mixed-uses at those properties. These redevelopment efforts will facilitate the redevelopment of older, 
significantly-deteriorated apartment complexes and 
collectively add as many as 2,500 new market-rate housing units into the Corridor. This growth in market-rate housing will be implemented in close collaboration with a detailed housing diversity approach that seeks to 
provide quality replacement housing to maintain housing 
affordability for Brookhaven’s current workforce.”  
  2.  CENSUS URBANIZED AREA DESIGNATION  
 
As required per USDOT’s NOFO, the six municipalities along 
the Buford Highway corridor c onstitute a “significant portion” 
(more than 15%) of the overall population of their urbanized 
area per the 2010 census data.     Dividing the demonstration area 
population of municipalities at  522,941 by the three (urbanize d) 
counties they span (pop. 2,417,795) yields:    21.6%

3.  CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CITY 
a.  Existing Transit System 
 
                                   
 
 
 Atlanta and the six municipality area proposed for this Smart C ities 
Challenge encompass a network of  existing transportation servic es 
typical of a mid-size city.  The following lists the elements t o 
further connect and integrate th rough demonstration project:  
i. MARTA commuter rail, which offers the Lindbergh Center 
Station at the SW end of the pr oposed corridor.   This densely 
developed station is named for L indbergh Drive, itself renamed 
in 1927 in honor of pioneer aviator Charles Lindbergh, which 
is the source of the pr oposed branding of the BRT 
demonstration as “Lindy” – which  would also serve as the first 
direct rapid Transit from Fulton to Gwinnet Counties, a new Lindbergh to Duluth line.  
ii. AMTRAK’s Atlanta station is  not far from the Lindbergh 
MARTA station, and the two are i n fact planned to be connected 
by the northern loop of the Atlan ta Beltline, a long-term light  
rail development which is curr ently experiencing strong support  
while only in its phase as a bike/walk path along the future li ght 
rail right-of-way.  Alternately, AMTRAK is considering 
relocating (or adding) a station at the new “Assemble” Development in Doraville, which was the site of the former GM Plant, and suitably adjacent to the Doraville MARTA station.  
iii. The intersections of Eisenhower Interstate System I-20 (East-
West, passing through Atlanta from Augusta to Birmingham) I-
75 N-S from Chattanooga to Macon, and I-85 also N-S from 
Greenville SC to Montgomery AL.   Atlanta is also encircled by I-285, its 64-mile perimeter “bypass” constructed in 1969.  
iv. The busiest commercial airport in the world, Atlanta Hartsfield -
Jackson, nestled between I-75, I-85 and the south-side 
perimeter (I-285) about 12 miles south of the state capitol and  
downtown core.  Peachtree DeKalb Airport is a smaller 
Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 16 of 32  municipal airport directly adjacent to Buford Highway between 
Brookhaven and Chamblee, a few miles inside the I-285 perimeter, home to approximately 600 private and charter 
planes used for regional travel and not by large commercial jet s. 
v. Multiple bus terminals:   Greyhound, Gwinnett County Transit, 
Cobb County Transit, MARTA, Georgia Regional Transit 
Authority and private carriers such as Megabus.   There are als o 
“jitney” buses that run on Buford Highway making more 
frequent stops, wider pick-up areas offering cheaper service or  
more flexible transfers than the municipal buses.   Buckhead community runs a connector shuttle that is popular with office workers at lunchtime to get t o restaurants and shopping, 
particularly in the congested Lenox and Peachtree Road high-rise districts.  
vi. Freight trains with significant tonnage, including the bulk of 
container transfer to southeast regional trucking from the port  
of Savannah, roughly 250 miles to the south by rail.  
vii. A growing network of bike and wa lking trails, including the fas t 
developing Beltline neighborhoods which expect to encircle 
downtown Atlanta with landscaped pedestrian paths at a 
distance roughly 2-3 miles from t he Midtown core over the next 
several years.  The Atlanta Beltline originated from a GA Tech Master’s Thesis.   
b. Conducive Environment for proposed strategies 
The municipalities and multi-jurisdictional organizations 
referenced in this proposal offer the attached letters of suppo rt 
(some arriving right at submission time!) as evidence of their 
eagerness to begin a collaboration targeted on the Buford Highway corridor with guidance and technical assistance of 
U S DO T .     A  rep resen t ativ e s am p le o f  stu d ies  an d  in it iat i v es already underway in Atlanta demonstrate the readiness of 
leadership to work together.    (See Appendix I). 
Recent changes in leadership at MARTA have met with very 
positive reviews from citizens, elected and business leadership .    
Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed’s adm inistration has especially 
prioritized transportation innova tions, including the downtown 
Auburn Avenue trolley and Atlanta Beltline with their goals of 
connecting all in-town neighbor hoods, especially currently 
underserved ones, activating prev iously underutilized railroad 
right-of-ways as a series of h ealthful bike-walk trails.   
Georgia DOT has provided data  about Buford Highway to the 
corridor municipalities as they’ ve pressed forward with various  
plans for economic development with studies targeted at their respective sections of the arte rial through their respective to wns.   
This application partly originated as a follow-on to the econom ic 
development study completed by Brookhaven.    W i t h  w i d e -
ranging recommendations from their planning consultants’ final 
report, city leadership asked “How can we activate these recommendations?”  A survey of grant and related funding opportunities turned up USDOT’s Smart City Challenge which 
led to fresh overtures between t he corridor municipalities to 
energize their respective efforts into a “shovel-ready” plan an d 
activate it for the consortium.  USDOT hopes to catalyze a usef ul 
demonstration of leveraged land use for elsewhere for other similar sized municipalities, nationwide.  And so do we. 
c. Continuity of Committed Leadership 
MARTA board members extended transit chief Keith Parker’s 
contract by two years in 2015, keeping him at the agency 
through 2019.  MARTA Board Chair Robbie Ashe is quoted in Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 17 of 32  Atlanta Magazine, praising Parker’s service since 2012: “I thin k 
Keith gets that MARTA is at the cusp of a truly transformationa l 
period.”

us-back-on-track/#sthash.75VYyrb5.dpuf   
 
d. Integration with shared economy 
In 2015 MARTA began a partnershi p with the Uber ride-sharing 
company that facilitates passengers arranging ahead while ridin g 
public transit to have a ride share pick-up waiting at the stat ion 
or bus stop nearest their final destination.    MARTA allowed public use of the Wi-Fi connectiv ity that had been installed on  
all buses to support security cam eras. More information is here : 
http://commuting.blog.ajc.co m/2015/07/23/marta-pilots-free-
wi-fi-on-buses-and-uber-partnership/  
e. Open Data to fuel entrepreneurship 
The City of Atlanta already opera tes an open data website with 
performance metrics published monthly from virtually every public safety or operational department.   The data is viewable  
in charts and tables or is downloadable for inspection and 
analysis from http://foratlanta.github.io/.    T h e  w e b s i t e  i s  
operated by the Mayor’s Office of Innovation and Performance, 
with whom the Lindy team collaborating for City of Atlanta’s input to this application.    I n  a d d ition, Atlanta’s Office of 
Sustainability tracks the city’s success at delivering services  in 
the context of energy efficiency and environmental goals. http://www.atlantaga.gov/index.aspx?page=154    T h e s e  t w o  
web portals are presented as examples of our current readiness.  
 4.  SITE MAP (See next page.)  
5.  ALIGNMENT WITH VISION POINT ELEMENTS 
TECHNOLOGY ELEMENTS 
1. Urban Automation  –  T h e  “ L i n d y ”  B R T  /  T O D  l a n d - u s e  
overlays and connected ride/bi ke share will utilize urban 
automation by integrating real-time rapid transit vehicle and rider GPS location to arrange connections.   Riders will be advised when to arrive at a pick-up in order to reliably attain  
their ultimate destination, assembling the best combination of 
connections based on user inputs and the status of the comprehensive transportation system components. 
2. Connected Vehicles  – The BRT vehicles will be run in a 
combination of roadway and dedica ted (or virtual) right-of-way 
as it assembled from available s ections of the hi ghway corridor .   
Where possible, the BRT vehicles will run in dedicated lanes optimized by signal coordinati on and shared use of minimal 
space afforded by ITS technology, minimizing congestion 
impact on the remaining components of the “complete streets.” 
3. Intelligent, Sensor Based Infrastructure  –  S e n s o r s  w i l l  
detect when riders are at stops or need to cross streets, when cars 
are stacking at bottlenecks, when service delivery can be 
improved by platooning vehicles , when to increase service 
speeds to maintain schedule reliability.    One of several syst em 
design goals for ITS-oriented de velopment, after safety and 
throughput, is to optimizing system reliability and increase on -
time performance.

4. Urban Analytics  - A Brookings Institution study found that 
only 3.4 percent of metro Atlanta-area jobs are reachable by transit within 45 minutes (from a respective employee’s dwelling.)  Only 22 percent are reachable by transit within a 9 0-
minute one-way commute trip.   http://reason.or g/news/show/to-
improve-atlantas-transit-sys tem#sthash.bgUkyZMD.dpuf   This 
is precisely the type of measurable statistic that improved 
performance along a BRT corridor of 200,000 citizens can impact.   As Atlanta continues to grow, a greater number of bot h 
jobs and housing must be made accessible from the comprehensive public trans it options for travel. 
5. User-focused Mobility Services and Choices 
The Atlanta Regional Commission advocates “Complete 
Streets” development for the Me tro Area.  The citi es of Decatur  
and Roswell have adopted versions  of these policies which are 
implemented to enable safe street access for all users .   T h e  
flexible collection of policies and design standards that make up 
a typical Complete Streets program have now been adopted in 
over 850 jurisdictions in the United States, including 31 state s, 
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia.   The author of the term “Complete Streets”, David Goldberg, communications director for Smart Growth America, who suggested it for use in 2003, is a Decatur, GA resident .  
These same principles are envisioned to be included in the 
Buford Highway corridor BRT so that pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and transit riders of all ages and abilities will saf ely 
move along and across complete streets.  For Atlanta residents with disabilities, much of the M etro Area is presently served b y MARTA’s Paratransit Service, on a day-ahead reserved basis.
 
Service is provided with special  lift-equipped vans on a curb-t o-
curb, shared ride basis.  This service would also be integrated  
into the operation of the Lindy BRT.     
6.  Urban Delivery & Logistics 
There were actually two revolutionary innovations that 
combined to make “e-commerce” possible (presently 5.4% of 
US GDP, or about $900B of the total $18 Trillion US economy is now on-line.)   Besides websites with s hopping carts and “Buy 
Now” buttons, the other innovation of the 1980s-1990s was 
super-efficient, reliable, privatized, demand-priced shipping b y 
Fedex, UPS and others.   Fedex st arted flying internationally i n 
1984.  They now earn $49B per year shipping packages globally.   
EBay’s 2015 volume hit $300B in world-wide online auction transactions, and all that stuff had to be delivered from selle r to 
buyer. An ever-growing factor is home delivery of packages 
from internet-based “fulfillment” businesses such as Amazon.com. Amazon started by competing with brick and mortar bookstores, but since branched out into household 
products and groceries, working from a massive base of distributed warehouses.   Amazon spent $8B loading and 
shipping boxes in 2015, up 33% ove r the previous year.  A new 
service at Amazon allows customers to pick items to pack a box up to 45lbs and have it delivered next day for about $6 shippin g.    
A truly Smart City will anticip ate the hyper-growing needs of 
home and business deliveries as the pressures of time and road congestion change “normal” consumer shopping behaviors.   
Complete Street designs will include package drop-off and 
delivery turnouts, driveways, shipping entrances and loading Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 20 of 32  docks for delivery trucks, vans, cars , (and possibly, in the 
future), delivery drones and robots.   Robots are already picki ng 
and packing the 45lb. boxes in Amazon warehouses, by the way. 
7.  Strategic Business Models  & Partnering Opportunities 
Metro Atlanta is a serial innova tor in the realm of PPPs (Publi c-
Private Partnerships).   Having successfully used PPPs to 
complete many components of downtown revitalization in the 1990’s, the City has returned to this strategic model to with t he 
BeltLine, the most comprehensiv e revitalization undertaken in 
the (modern) City of Atlanta an d among the largest, most wide-
ranging urban redevelopment and mobility projects currently 
underway in the United States.   T he BeltLine is repurposing 22  
miles of disused rail corridors i nto a network of public parks,  
multi-use trails and transit, circling downtown and connecting 45 neighborhoods directly to each other.  Atlanta BeltLine Inc. , 
an affiliate of Invest Atlanta (formerly the Atlanta Developmen t 
Authority), is the PPP entity tasked with planning and executin g 
in partnership with City of Atlanta Departments and private partners. Its functions include specifying the BeltLine plan; leading efforts to secure fundi ng; to engage the community; 
manage and execute the BeltLine plan, including the 
coordination of all vendors and suppliers. Atlanta BeltLine Inc . 
is also responsible for tracki ng and reporting progress to the 
Atlanta City Council, Atlanta Pub lic Schools and Fulton County,  
the three taxing authorities that authorized the BeltLine TAD legislation in 2005.     
 
 8.  Smart Grid, Roadway Electrification, EVs 
Atlanta is home to General Electric’s (GE) Power Systems 
Division as well as Siemens, both major international Smart Grid vendors.     The modernization of electric power in the US 
is partly based on the “de-car bonization” of generating sources .   
Keeping track of who is preferentially buying cleaner, but typically more expensive energy, as well as planning how to 
manage peak use are encompassed in Smart Grid policies and 
equipment.   For the proposed electrified Buford Highway BRT, 
planning will take into account opportunities to charge vehicle s 
using cheaper off-peak energy, and to utilize clean sources of generated power to meet climate change mitigation targets.    
Studies show that EVs charged wit h electricity originating from  
natural gas generation plants are much more efficient and contribute less to global warmi ng than burning natural gas in 
vehicle’s combustion engines.  
E V - t y p e  b u s e s  a r e  e x t r a o r d i n a r i l y  e f f i c i e n t ,  w i t h  f e w e r  
drivetrain parts, no loss of gas combustion energy as heat, and  
the ability to recapture energy from braking into stored batter y 
capacity.   EV buses are presently commercially viable with 200+ mile ranges, fast-charging systems, environmentally non-
toxic batteries with 12-year warranted capacity, and lighter, 
carbon-fiber chassis and body c onstruction.  The consortium 
has had initial conversations with both ProTerra and BYD, the major EV bus manufacturers in the U.S.  ProTerra’s east coast manufacturing facility is in nearby Greenville, SC, 120 miles N E 
of Duluth, GA, where there would likely be several “fast charge ” 
stations at the end/turn-around of the BRT route.  ProTerra’s buses can be fully charged in under 10 minutes before running the 18 miles back to Lindbergh Center, fu lly air-conditioned fo r Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 21 of 32  passengers on a hot day.   Except for signage and safety lighti ng 
at bus-stops, the latest EV bus batteries would not require on-route recharge, so roadway electrification is limited.  
9.  Connected, Involved Citizens 
Atlanta is home to numerous innova tive citizen’s groups focused  
on transportation and associated quality of life issues.   A ty pical 
example is PEDS ( http://peds.org/about-us/  )  w h i c h  i s  a  
Complete Street and pedestrian advocacy group.    Their 
members volunteer to survey streets and sidewalks, gathering data to assist in the selection of appropriate design and 
construction improvements to meet the needs of neighborhoods. 
More formalized community involvement in Georgia is enabled 
by community improvement districts (CIDs).  Article IX, Section VII of the Georgia Cons titution authorizes CIDs as 
entities to fund and manager certain governmental services 
including street and road constr uction and maintenance, parks 
and recreation, storm water and sewage systems, water systems, public transportation systems, and other services  and facilitie s. 
The administrative body of a CID can levy taxes, fees and 
assessments within the CID, not to exceed 2.5 percent of the 
assessed value of the real non-residential property.   The Buckhead CID is a strong example of this community-based model of local citizen -driven planning and execution of special  
projects.   T he Buckhead CID formed in 1999, encompasses 2.5 
square miles in the northern commercial core where Peachtree 
Road and Lenox Road cross GA400, an area of dense development and commercial high-rises.  The CID has spent over $60M of authorized taxation on its mission to “maintain a more accessible and livable urban environment; to make meaningful improvements in the transportation network and 
public realm that connect people and places.”   
SMART CITIES ELEMENTS  
10.  Architecture & Standards 
The intent while implementing the proposed Buford Highway 
BRT is to utilize all applicable best practices from the Smart City movement and make use of emerging innovations as they come into focus from around the world.      The consortium along 
Buford Highway would therefore attempt to adhere to principles 
pioneered for ICT in cities like Groningen, Netherlands which suggests:   a) Data should be utilized in response to Customer-driven processes;  b) Data should be collected and stored once and re-used, rather than collected multiple times; c)  Data sho uld 
be compliant with the needs of re-use and d) patterned for simp le 
use, rather than overly complex; as well as e) be designed for 
integration from outside, such a s from other applications which  
could benefit from an open, accessible data schema.  
11.  Low-cost, efficient, secure & resilient ICT 
The Smart City Challenge’s IT-design imperatives to make data 
open, usable by outside entities and to align ICT developments 
with business requirements ar e implicit goals of envisioned 
project implementation along Bufo rd Highway.   It also follows 
that the data architecture for the proposed Buford Highway BRT would similarly incentivize low-cost, secure & resilient solutions for its data connect ivity and to support assorted 
applications running off its systems and data services.   
Standards for connected and aut onomous vehicles appear to be 
among the elements most especially suited to USDOT’s level of Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 22 of 32  technical expertise and assistance.   This would also be an are a 
of significant interest to Geo rgia Tech’s Institute for Robotic s 
and Intelligent M achines, which we count as an informal 
consortium partner and research resource.  (See attached letter .)    
GA Tech researchers in robotics and vehicle automation would 
likely be interested in the independent assessment role, observing and reporting on efforts to implement various levels of autonomous operation, connecting BRT vehicles to the smart 
street elements, sensors, signals, and intelligent signage.  
12.  Smart Land Use 
The municipalities along the Buford Highway corridor are 
deeply engaged in the process of  considering existing land-uses  
while planning ways to integrate latest best rezoning practices  to 
address safety, mobility and quality-of-life issues for constituents (to reduce conge stion) as well as preserve 
workforce (affordable) housing and activate transportation-
oriented redevelopment.    Various improvement plans and Economic Development Strategy studies include parcel-by-
parcel assessments and recommend repositioning strategies.    Typical of these studies is the one from the 2014 Buford Highway Economic study commissioned by Brookhaven: 
“The redevelopment schemes presented include an effort 
to add open space to the study area, establish a multi-use trail network along the North Fork with connection 
opportunities within the study  area, support and develop 
a viable mix of market rate  and affordable housing, and 
introduce new commercial zone s that support the vision 
of Buford Highway as a thriving international 
community.” 6.  IDENTIFY & RATE RISKS 
A POLICY RISKS.   In the past  GDOT’s acceptance of 
the necessary “Lane Diet” for Buford Highway was a non-
starter.   Today, some of those long-held positions are softeni ng.  
In Brookhaven GDOT add central medians and alternating left turn central turnouts in lieu of B uHi’s standard central two-wa y 
striped left turn median, the latter often being referred to as  the 
“suicide lane” in local parlance.  
B INSTITUTIONAL RISKS 
One risk is surely the difficulty forming of a regional coaliti on 
across six municipalities a nd three counties (and three 
congressional districts) in an ar ea of substantial automobile 
congestion, with associated commuter distress and public outcry  
over previous insufficient pla nning and/or investment. Public 
meetings are quite often vociferous when agendas include traffic, parking or approval of a  multi-family zoning variance 
come up.  Nevertheless, the fact that a BRT shows up as a 
possible next best step f or Buford Highway among multiple  
stakeholder’s planning documents indicates it’s an idea whose time has come. 
The coalition plans to explore th e best options for setting up 
legal structures to operate a s eparately branded BRT (whether 
contracted to MARTA or not) a nd to solicit potential public-
private partnerships during the planning period afforded by being a finalist in the Smart Cities Challenge, should USDOT select “Lucky Lindy” as a propos al worthy of further study. 
7.  OUTLINE TEAM PARTNERS & STAKEHOLDERS 
A. PARTNERS.  The Governance process to enable the 
municipal  stakeholders identified in t his proposal to function as Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 23 of 32  a virtual single authority unde r non-binding memoranda of 
understanding is an important par t of the concept and initial 
planning process.   Regardless, there is capacity to implement 
technically in several of the identified stakeholders, given 
cooperation from the others.  
B. OTHER STAKEHOLDERS   The full list of stakeholders 
at this conceptual stage of the “Lindy” BRT include the 
following:   
 Atlanta (Buckhead Community) 
 Atlanta Regional Commission 
 Assemble Development (Integral Gude) 
 Atlanta BeltLine, Inc. 
 Brookhaven 
 Chamblee 
 City of Atlanta Mayor’s Office 
 DeKalb Peachtree Airport 
 Doraville 
 Duluth 
 GA Dept. of Transportation 
 Georgia Tech 
 MARTA 
 Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce 
 Norcross 
 Oglethorpe University 
A southern “spur” could involve Emory U. & the VA Hospital 
C UNIVERSITY RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS 
Two potential university/research partners are identified at th is 
project conceptual stage:   Georgia Tech, particularly thr ough its Institute of Robotic and Intelligent Machines, led by professor  
Henrik Christensen, and Oglethor pe University, led by President  
Lawrence Schall.   Both of these leaders have attached letters 
expressing their interest i n the proposed project.

a.  Arterial Miles –  City of Atlanta operates 75 streets it 
d e s i g n a t e s  a s  a r t e r i a l ,  t o t a l i n g  1 5 8 . 2 4  m i l e s .    T h e  B u f o r d  
Highway corridor, from City of Atlanta to Duluth is 
approximately 18 miles along GA13/US23.  
b.  Freeway is called “Interstate” in Atlanta.  Freeways are in 
California, but with the advent o f demand-priced HOV lanes on 
I-85, there is often now a difference between the free lanes  
(which are predictably stopped at 5pm heading into Gwinnett County) compared to the variable- price per mile lane that’s sti ll 
moving on the far-left asphalt.  
c. Transit in Atlanta includes inter-city rail (Amtrak), 
Commuter Rail (MARTA, but only the two major axis with some spur lines), MARTA buses, Taxis, Ride-Shares, school buses, “jitney” buses in some ar eas, private autos and bicycles .

e. ICT – Information & Communication Technology - 
Understanding that Atlanta metro constitutes roughly 50% of the  
population and economy of Georgia, here are some ICT stats for the entire state.  
[Source:  http://tagstateoftheindustry.com/2015/  ] 
Information Security 
 GA is among the top three states in the US for IT security 
 GA is home to more than 115 IT security companies 
 GA companies employ over 10,000 network engineers 
 Over 25% of the worldwide security revenue market share is 
generated by companies in GA (---Gartner, Inc.) 
Financial Tech 
 GA is third in the nation for Financial Tech 
 GA is home to more than 93 financial technology companies 
 Eight out of the Top 10 Financial Tech 100 Companies have 
operations in GA (---American Banker) 
Communication Services 
 GA is among the top 5 states for employment in IT 
communications, employing 61,000 people 
 There are more than 250 long distance telecommunications 
providers in the state 
 Atlanta is a transmission hub for the country’s two largest 
fiber optic trunk routes 
 Metro Atlanta ranks in the top five U.S. markets for total 
bandwidth and fiber access (---GA Power) 
Health IT 
 GA is the nation’s health IT capitol 
 GA health IT companies produce >$4 billion annual revenue  Over 186 health IT companies operate in GA, employing 
15,000 people 
Logistics IT 
 GA is home to nearly 11,000 provi ders of logistics services 
 90 percent of the top 25 global, third-party logistics 
providers have operations in GA 
 GA has more than 1,000,000 logistics-connected employees 
 GA is 5th in the nation fo r logistics employment 
 
f.  ITS – Integrated Transportation Systems - Transportation 
Management Centers & Field Equipment.    MARTA currently 
operates the most extensive of these components in Atlanta.  Their systems are sophisticated enough to track ridership of approximately 50 million unlinked trips per year, which was up 
nearly 3% in 2015.   MARTA is planning a major capital 
program with track and rail service extensions budgeted at 
nearly $8B, presumably with equipment modernization to match.   A Buford Highway BRT is not currently in that budget.  
g. Smart Grid (Electric) Infrastructure - Vehicle Charging 
Stations.   The pr oposed BRT EV charging is discussed on pages 
20-21.   As more passenger EVs enter the market and daily use, the “Complete Streets” vernacular will begin to include car chargers in underground parking areas, fast charge stations 
(similar to gas stations now) and also possibly “remote fueling ” 
services, where charging (or LPG/Gas) are delivered to cars, 
rather than making cars drive t o a distributed network of 
charging, gas, refill stations.  
 9A.   DATA CURRENTLY COLLECTED BY CITY(s) Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 25 of 32  All of the municipalities in the coalition for a Buford Highway  
BRT are collecting data.   At a minimum they have a GIS for property, zoning, taxes, parcel ownership, improvements, 
building permits and fines.  The most sophisticated are sharing  
community policing data and work-order level metrics for delivery of city services including examples of Human Services  
(highlighting missing persons rep orts, reporting crimes and mos t 
wanted lists for law enforcement), Transit  (advising of planned 
detours, lane blockages, allowi ng citizen to report potholes, 
traffic complaints or missing signage), and Public Works  
(reporting services outages, track ing water-saving toilet rebat e 
programs, gathering mosquito control requests, and allowing reservations of public picnic shelters and ball-courts.) 
9B   NEW DATA TO BE COLLECTED 
Determining the appropriate sources and level of detail, 
currency of ITS, rider and other data is an important part of t he 
concept and initial planning pr ocess envisioned for the post-
p l a n n i n g  a w a r d  p h a s e  o f  t h i s  C h a l l e n g e  a p p l i c a t i o n .     T h e  demonstration would be awash in potential data sources and would be designing for sensor-b ased data utilization, rider 
inputs, application functionality, etc.  
C EXISTING DATA POLICIES  - Sources of policies :  
Right now the most applicable policies operating anything similar to the proposed BRT are aboard MARTA.    MARTA 
operates the current traditi onal #39 bus route on Buford 
Highway, as well as the existin g Lindbergh Central station.   
Adapting those policies to new equipment and a new landscape would be an important aspect of the demonstration.   Cross-
cutting partnerships to advance smart city tech:  Are these in any advanced state yet in Atlanta?   This would be where a new 
open-architecture ICT system for the BRT, for the street’s othe r 
traffic-flow functions & controls, and for the off-site monitor ing 
to enable reliable advance plan ning would come into play for 
use by single rider/commuters or  persons seeking some service 
along the Corridor. This will re quire partnerships between 
hardware, software, application developers, R&D, high-reliability testing and system planning/management.  Right now 
a smart phone can be used to find the best rated dumplings in 
Doraville, or check whether your favorite restaurant is still o pen. 
The phenomenon of critical mass of useful data applies.  As far  
as defining policies and operating procedures to establish 
and maintain systems, interfaces, maintain data integrity 
and share data, i t’s not possible in the scope of this proposal to 
outline what that will involve and how much data needs to be 
served by municipalities compared to what “evolves” for people to use once there is a need and an entrepreneur figuring out ho w 
to serve it as a way to aggregate users (for advertisements or possible crowd-funde d opportunities.)   
1 0 .   A P P R O A C H  T O  &  U S E  O F  E X I S T I N G  I T S  
STANDARDS, ARCHITECTURE, CERTIFICATION PROCESSES OF ITS AND CONNECTED VEHICLES.   
This is somewhat discussed on page 21 (Section C.10), but this 
is clearly the area where USDOT technical support and input 
from commercial researchers is n eeded, and would be invited to 
work with the Buford Highway BRT to demonstrate the implementation of these technologies.    It goes wit hout saying 
that these must be extremely reliable and documentable as 
liability- reducing , rather than adding liability to the 
transportation system.  An important financial concern is just Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 26 of 32  how much liability insurance could be reduced by the operation 
of autonomous, connected vehicles, and is a statistical reducti on 
of accidents sufficient to reduce the cost of coverage  
11. MEASURABLE GOALS & O BJECTIVES to monitor 
impact of BRT implementation on: 
1.  Mobility -  Reduce the “reserve-ahead” time for door-to-
transit by paratransit option from 24 hours to 4 hours.    Redu ce 
the bus travel time from Doraville to Lindbergh from 47 minutes  
including wait to 40 minutes vi a signal coordination and BRT. 
2.   Safety  -  Reduce pedestrian strik ings on Buford Highway by 
50% (down from approximately 10 per year). 
3. Efficiency – Reduce insurance costs for public transit buses 
by increasing enhanced controls, sensor-based warnings, lane 
monitoring, parking assistance,  driver alertness sensing and 
heads-up displays.    
4. Sustainability – Decrease known ecological impacts by 
taking diesel and/or combustion engines out of Buford Highway 
bus circulation.   Reduce oil, soot, and toxic battery use with  EVs 
that have none of these impacts.    W o r k  w i t h  E V  b u s  
manufacturers to enhance bus des igns to encourage adoption by 
other municipalities, achieve lower cost of manufacture (i.e., 
determine rate of positive feedback from successful 
d e m o n s t r a t i o n s . )    D o  t h e  s a m e  f o r  r i d e r s h i p  i n c r e a s e :   A s  ridership increases, service can be more frequent, improving 
service, increasing predictabi lity and improving conditions for  
businesses from customers who can step off and on a BRT as it 
moves through a corridor with multiple amenities. 5. Climate Change – Determine true decrease in Greenhouse 
gases (GHGs) by all factors per rider/mile compared to in-place  
traditional bus-lines.    Determine if a metric is associated with 
creating a business district close to a viable market-rate rent al 
housing attractive for its quick connection to the downtown cor e 
or other nodes along the transit route such as CDC, Peachtree DeKalb Airport, or Assembly Development. 
The consortium of municipali ties understands the need for 
independent evaluation by third parties , and will offer open 
access to planning and implementation processes via observation, interviews, surveys  or experiments designed to 
achieve objective evaluation of targeted measures. 
12. CAPACITY / READINESS 
A. Magnitude of Executive Commitment – at this conceptual 
stage of the proposed demonstration/Challenge, all that is 
required of the coalition cities and their leadership is to be 
prepared to enter into the mult i-stakeholder plann ing process at 
the next stage.    Who those stakeholders will be precisely  a t  
different times and in different living centers along the 18-mi le 
corridor will involve breaking down the demonstration area into  
similar geographic components, as well as into different tasks with deliverables that will ultimately be combined. For instanc e, 
zoning overlay studies to maximize the value of existing or available land for mixed-use TOD nodes will face different 
problems than technical ones related to determining how often 
to place “Express” stops based o n anticipated ri dership, transf er 
efficiency or tolerable wait times.   Measuring capacity prior to 
the first encounter of planners with the opportunity to address  Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 27 of 32  the real problems that will confront implantation seems 
premature.  
B. Workforce Capacity – No serious BRT planning will begin 
until after MARTA and Gwinnett County Transit find they can each “let go” of their respective parts of bus service along Buford Highway (currently tran sferred at the Doraville MARTA 
s t a t i o n . )    O n c e  t h a t  p o s s i b i l i t y  i s  e n a b l e d  b y  a  t r u l y  f e a s i b l e 
regional proposal, there is amp le staff at either agency to 
collaborate and design the BRT system that would serve them both better than the existing “relay” at the county line.   At the 
SW end, there is similarly untapped energy on the part of the urban core bike-walk-trail advocates to extend their “complete 
streets” to development further along any arterial.    T h e  
extraordinary enthusiasm for Atlanta BeltLine growth is showing that if we connect par ks with neighborhoods via bike 
and walking trails, people flock to them and make an amenity of  
having somewhere to go, and enj oying the way to get there.  
C. Degree of Infrastructure Readiness – as pointed out in 
discussion on page 3, it’s not so much the “readiness” of Bufor d 
Highway that is as beneficial as its outdatedness  and ripeness to 
change.   That being said, GDOT has done a good job keeping 
the seven lanes of asphalt smoothly paved, the storm-sewers 
properly sized so the roadway doesn’t flood, and the keeping th e 
stripes on the “suicide lanes” colorfast. 
D. Data and Performance Mgmt. Capabilities – See page 24, 
item “e” for an outline of Georgia’s prominence in five differe nt 
tech-related sectors.   This is where Atlanta makes its claim t o 
being the Silicon Valley of the South. (Without Google, though. ) 
13. OPPORTUNITIES TO LEVERAGE FUNDING A.  Cost Share – Our planning target will be to reach a 50%-
50% share with USDOT because a BRT and multiple TOD nodes along the entire corridor constitute a larger undertaking  
than the Smart City Challenge Implementation Grant.   
Fortunately, the demonstration also intends to become self-
funding in the long run, or at least fully justified by the 
elimination of costly externalities that are direct benefits of  the 
implementation.   
B.  In-kind donations – Brookhaven is seeking to acquire land 
for a southern district park near Buford Highway.   The BRT program could offer the pattern whereby the City can acquire th e 
Park as an in-kind donation und er a structured PPP with a 
developer that acquires a larger  parcel, successfully develops a 
TOD node to a higher density all owed by an overlay which 
leaves sufficient upside to donate the park land in trust as a shared public amenity.  
C.  Partnering – Each Municipality would likely enter into its 
own PPPs in its jurisdiction, though shared templates and expertise among them would be useful for issuing RFQs and evaluating developer proposals fo r TODs.  The coalition itself 
could be a partnership for certain business functions.   Most 
partnerships would be structured to be revenue neutral for the 
municipalities, except for contributions to “endowment” funds to support the BRT without additio nal taxation now or later. 
 
Twenty Questions  specifically drawn from the USDOT Smart 
Cities Challenge NOFO, restated as simple questions.) 
1. What are one or two MAJOR transportation problems 
facing your constituents? Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 28 of 32  a) Congestion on the major surface roadways between 
sections of the city makes auto travel difficult when citizens must make trips for jobs, interviews, amenities, parks, recreat ion 
& entertainment, retail, clinic s, schools, government offices, 
festivals, visiting friends & family, connecting to regional transit, etc. b) Slow or non-existent public  transit options for youth, 
elderly, disabled or non-car owning citizens. 
c) Buford Highway through DeKalb County is the most 
dangerous stretch of road for ped estrians in Georgia, with 154 
pedestrians struck since 2003 and nine fatalities in the past 1 0 
years.   Long stretches have six lanes of speeding traffic, crosswalks a mile apart, stoplights sporadically placed, no sidewalks and bus stops that are nothing more than a sign 
immediately adjacent to cars, trucks and SUVs zooming by in 
lanes of traffic just a few feet away. 
2. Do you have an idea for a demonstration of a solution 
to transportation problems facing your constituents? 
a. A Bus Rapid Transit line from Midtown Atlanta to 
Gwinnett through six municipalities to share amenities along a 
planned “Live-Work-Play” zoned overlay to reduce congestion, 
increase connection speed and enable people to live an urban lifestyle without r eliance on private automobiles. 
b. Self-financing of needed infrastructure changes by 
estimating and tracking property value increases generated for 
developers by increased housing density, changed height limits 
and relaxation of traditional parking requirements. 
3. How would technology play a role in the suggested 
solution (including applications that would serve users/citizens/commuters)? a. Technology would enable the “Rapid” element of the 
proposed BRT.     (Connected vehicles would coordinate on the 
road with virtual right-of-way enhancements, timed signals for 
express buses, algorithms to  time arrivals at regional 
transportation connection nodes, providing arrival times at eve ry 
stop to allow riders smooth planning.) b. Feedback from riders and integrated data collection systems would facilitate rapid adjustment of the system to meet  
evolving needs.   (Where and when to add new stops, how to 
maximize efficient use of energy, when to surge and taper service, offer suggestions for nearest businesses accessible fr om 
BRT at current stop, etc.) 
4. How would the proposed solution integrate with 
management and operations of the City? 
a. The “City” in this case would consist of a consortium of 
six municipalities who share the corridor with GA DOT and the 
Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA.)    The city’s roles would be to struct ure zoning and incubate/serve 
businesses along the corridor that meet as many of citizens’ lo cal 
needs as possible, to promote Li ve-Work-Play district aspects 
that attract residents who want to give up private cars in exchange for less commute time, less car maintenance expense (& a higher standard of hous ing enabled by savings.) 
b. Operations of the City w ould include paying close 
attention to the needs of the s pecial transporta tion-oriented 
corridor.   Police would be r esponsive to problems that 
prevented the BRT from operating smoothly, simply because it serves a great number of people and would also be the “gateway”  
for many visitors to the city.   Safety and quality of life iss ue 
patrolling, community policing, s hared use of virtual right-of-
way signaling for emergency vehicles (Fire & Ambulance) Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 29 of 32  would also integrate with the regional 911 and 
emergency/disaster responders.    I f  t h e r e  w e r e  a  n e e d  f o r  a n  
evacuation of large numbers of people from the TOD corridor, 
the BRT would necessarily be part of that planning. 
5. How would the proposed BRT/TOD Corridor impact 
safety, efficiency, and sustainable movement of people and goods? 
a. The BRT and the TOD infrastructure (bus stops, 
walkable sidewalks, and the gra dual but eventual transformation  
of setbacks & parking areas to mi xed-use facilities) would be 
vastly safer than the current Buf ord Highway pattern of use tha t 
is setup almost exclusively for private cars.    Pedestrians wo uld 
be favored in the “complete streets” redesign.   Efficiency is improved by fostering local businesses close to residential use s 
to service the needs of most, if not all trips.   If a business  is not 
near enough to walk to, it can be reached by a quick BRT trip, which incidentally allows residents to move small carts for groceries and heavier items across fully ADA-compliant ramps at every transition.   A senior who can’t drive can nonetheless 
move supplies or receive deliver ies that can arr ive by BRT, too . 
 b. A Buford Highway BRT/TOD would be implemented in accordance with a “Complete Streets” approach recommended by the Atlanta Regional Commission, with proven Safety, 
Health, Economic, Environmenta l benefits while serving the 
needs of pedestrians, bicyclists, automobiles, public transit riders, and the delivery of goods.    
 
Economic Benefits for Individuals 
“Economic Benefits include lower transportation costs for 
families. Americans spent an average of 18 cents of every dolla r on transportation, with the poorest fifth of families spending 
more than double that figure. In fact, most families spend far more on transportation than on food. When residents have the 
opportunity to walk, bike, or take transit, they have more cont rol 
over their expenses by replacing car trips with these inexpensi ve 
options. Taking public transport ation, for example, saves 
individuals $9,581 each year.”  ---   National Complete Streets  
Coalition 
6.  How will the coalition close technical and policy gaps? 
a.  The Buford Highway proposal  envisions the creation of a 
standing committee that inter acts between stakeholders by 
appointment of the elected offi cials of the municipalities serv ed.    
In Atlanta there are already re gional (ARC, MARTA), county 
and municipal officials dedica ted to the implementation of 
public policy and to address need s and issues that a Buford 
Highway BRT/TOD project would also address.   The need for a specific body to steer, advocate and report on Buford Highway’s progress is driven by the unique needs of the 
integration, the demonstration component(s), and to serve as th e 
decision and information dissemination agent, were the same 
project to be implemented in another city with less regional policy and technical oversight expertise. 
7. What is the existing transp ortation system in the area to 
be serviced by the demonstration? 
a. The roughly 18-mile corridor from Midtown to Duluth 
in Gwinnett County is served by a patchwork system, some regional (MARTA serves Fulton & DeKalb but not Gwinnett), 
some public, and some private (At least two private shuttle services operate alongside  MARTA and Gwinnet County 
Transit buses.)    Georgia Regional Transit operates buses on t he Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 30 of 32  I-85 interstate.  Buckhead opera tes a connector service in the 
Lenox area. b. Unfortunately, Buford Highway suffers from its present 
and historic “incomplete street” (car-centric) design.   As suc h it 
is demonstrably dangerous, unhealthful, not conducive to walking or bicycle riding, it reduces options for housing to 
include only people who can afford or operate cars, it adds to congestion because its current bus service is not rapid and doe s 
not take advantage of all technology integration.   In short, t he 
corridor is ready for a change tha t will very likely transform the 
use of the land around it, in ways  that will make it desirable for 
resid en ts, b u sin esse s, cu sto m ers an d  v isito rs.   Id eally , i t w i ll 
become known in the city as an easy to reach Live-Work-Play neighborhood that transcends m unicipal boundaries and reduces 
rather than contributes to the difficulties of Atlanta’s world 
famous sprawl. 
8. How would the proposed demonstration fuel 
entrepreneurship and innovation to improve citizens’ lives, create jobs, and spur economic development? 
The average home-to-work commu te for an Atlanta resident in 
a car takes hours of time spent controlling a vehicle in traffic , 
which really benefits  no one but that indi vidual.  The same tim e 
spent in a vehicle piloted by someone else (or autonomously) allows essentially “free” time, w hich can be used to study, rea d, 
work on personal business opportuni ties, or just rest so that t he 
commuter can be more sociable, active, and alert when spending time at home with friends or family.   Unscientifically, drivin g 
in traffic makes people crabby. 
9. How would open city data be shared with the public or 
other systems in such a way to preserve privacy, security and 
other safeguards? This demonstration would undert ake as a starting point the 
principles suggested by leading cities in the movement toward 
more open data, such as G roningen, Netherlands. 
10. How do the demonstration cities currently exhibit their 
commitment to managing opera tions, transportation or 
other administrative data as a strategic asset? 
The municipalities in our coaliti on clearly strive to make thei r 
respective websites into useful portals and transparent reporte rs 
of their day-to-day operati ons, punctuated by boosterism, 
consensus-building and serious  public servi ce announcements. 
11. Which of the demonstration cities or systems currently 
utilizes Intelligent Transportation Systems or operate a Traffic Management Center? 
       It’s Marta!   (That’s also one of MARTA’s slogans.) 
12. What area will serve as the ‘central business district’ 
in the demonstration as suggested in the USDOT NOFO? 
The corridor itself will aim to be the central business distric t for 
itself, but also serve as a conduit for commuters from one end of 
the BRT to the other.   18 miles is a lot of room for commercia l 
businesses, service centers, m ore restaurants & places of 
entertainment, all of which mean jobs and places where one might walk to from either an affordable apartment or a market-rate one.   Officially, of c ourse, downtown Atlanta (and 
Midtown and Lenox or Perimeter Center) are the central 
business districts.   Atlanta’s business districts tend to be l inear 
and named “Peachtree Street.” 
13. What is the geographic area for the demonstration 
for the purposes of the  USDOT NOFO / Grant? 
The TOD overlays would likely encompass the parcels on both 
sides of Buford Highway, thickening at major cross-street nodes  
such as Clairmont, N. Druid Hills, E. Roxboro, Briarwood, Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 31 of 32  Chamblee-Tucker.  Perhaps 300’ o f width including the right-
of-way.    18 miles x 300’ is a pproximately 650 acres or exactl y 
four times the size of the Assemble Development in Doraville 
the site of the old GM plant. 
14. What can the demonstration stakeholders offer as 
evidence of committed leadership, authority, and capacity to carry out the demonstration throughout the period of  
performance and continue operation after the period of 
performance is over? 
Besides having our city defeated in war, burned to the ground, rebuilding it in 3 years into a capitol, being forced to stand down 
and then stand up against racism (collectively work through it,  
exporting principled civil dis obedience without late 20
th century 
riots), build the world’s busiest  airport and airline, host the  
Olympics, grow to the ninth largest MSA, stand as the germ-
fighters against world-wide epidemics, and diversify our metro area economy to include
 housing, construction, finance, 
technology, insurance, health car e, equipment manufacturing, 
shipping, food distribution, a uto suppliers, e-commerce and 
higher education, Atlanta has a reputation for being lazy and 
lacking follow-through .   (Tongue firmly in cheek.) 
15. How with the demonstration assess its 
reproducibility for other mi d-sized municipalities? 
a. Assessing the technical progress, difficulties, successes & 
failures, with emphasis on preferentially reproducing the succe ss 
(including documentation of the full process, best practices, &  
translation of the model into step by step instructions for oth er 
municipalities) is the focus of the academic stakeholders as t h i r d - p a r t y  i n d e p e n d e n t  r e s e a r c h e r s .     S i m i l a r  t o  A t l a n t a ’ s  Beltline initiative (which began as a Master’s Thesis by Ryan 
Gravel) the academic component of the proposed demonstration will be included from the start.     T h e  d e m o n s t r a t i o n  w ill be 
documented academically as an effort to change a previously ineffective multi-jurisdictional approach into one that will be  
measured with the intention of e nsuring reproducible results 
elsewhere in the metropolitan area or in other mid-sized municipalities.  
16. Are changes in governance required to implement 
this demonstration? 
a. No changes in current governance structures are 
required.  The existing governance structure is sufficient to 
undertaking planning, collaborati on, activation of different pa rts 
of the demonstration at different times by different municipalities, and preservation of existing autonomy and local  
control of resources. 
17. What are estimated savings anticipated in hours not 
spent by citizens stuck in traffi c and productivity potentially  
gained by this demonstration?  
a.  Unfortunately, this demonstration will not magically free u p 
congestion everywhere on Metro Atlanta’s roads, but it should 
have measurable effects, particularly in the NE corridor and 
especially across a three-county divide (Fulton-DeKalb-
Gwinnett) which otherwise hinde rs regional transportation 
solutions other than least-common denominator efforts (i.e. road-widening.)   We need to create more places to live in the 
city with “complete streets” and where automobiles are optional , 
and make it easy to get from there to other interesting, useful  
parts of the city, too. 
18. Does this demonstration qualify as a step toward 
next-generation management of  the municipalities involved?  
Yes, because part of the demonstration will be to generate an 
effective endowment (“rainy day fund” or equity pool) to ensure  Metro Atlanta Smart City Challenge:   Buford Highway Corridor BRT               Page 32 of 32  the long-term maintenance and capital improvements 
necessitated by the higher activity, but also higher utility.   See 
chart on page 7 for an indication of the timing of self-funded 
expansion.  
19. Is this demonstration part of an effort by the 
municipalities to become more attractive and competitive to residents and businesses consid ering relocation to the area?  
Yes, this is a critical component  of a strategy to reposition a s 
well as activate the corridor to higher uses while also preserv ing 
sufficient workforce housing in new mixed-use properties.    The 
more the corridor is activated, the greater the potential to leverage increasing land value s with zoning overlay(s) and/or 
TOD variances to generate funding for complete street amenities. 
20. How are the demonstration cities currently 
integrating shared use transportation options (bike share and car share options), and will the demonstration expand on these? 
MARTA is integrating ride-shari ng with transfers to and from 
transit stations to address th e “last mile” problem for some 
riders.  Our plan is to simila rly implement bike sharing at 
appropriate nodes along the BRT ( likely at the express stops) 
similar to what was just implemented in Lanzou, China . 
 
 
 
 
 EPILOGUE:   Charles Lindberg h’s Triumph & Thoughts 
After Lindbergh’s, solo fight acr oss the Atlantic, the aviator 
returned to Georgia Oct 11, 1927 for the largest parade that ha d 
yet travelled Peachtree St. in A tlanta, ending at Georgia Tech,  
where he gave a speech to 20,000 assembled.  
Over the following decades he s ettled down and applied his 
mechanical talent and adventurous spirit to inventions, includi ng 
rockets and an early version of an artificial heart    He lived  till 
1974, 72 years of age.  Late in life he embraced nature conservancy and cautioned societ y against blindly embracing 
technologies:  
“All the achievements of mankind have value only to the 
extent that they preserve and improve the quality of life.” In this same 1967 interview, he elaborated: “ The human 
future depends on our ability  to combine the knowledge 
of science with the wisdom of wildness .”

1. Application Overview and Roadmap 
The City of Buffalo ( Figure 1.1 ) and the 
Buffalo Niagara region are writing a new story—a story about how a “rust belt” region is retooling itself in the 21st century to meet the real challenge of how to live more sustainably in an era of economic and demographic change and environmental uncertainty. It is a story of old places with new people, fresh ideas, and new ways for working together to use our land more wisely, move more efficiently, create great places to live, ensure healthy and equitable communities, and meet the challenges of climate change and a transforming energy economy. Through the use of connectivity between vehicles, infrastructure, and people, combined with effective regional partnerships, Buffalo is well on its way to becoming a Smart City. 
Today, Buffalo is moving toward a sustainable future at all levels of society, incorporating 
actions in the community, government, and private entities in the area, making it an ideal location for a scalable and replicable implementation of the Smart City vision elements.   
The case for Buffalo is made in Section 2.  
The Smart City Challenge is an opportunity for the Niagara International Transportation 
Technology Coalition (NITTEC), with support from the Niagara Frontier Transportation 
Authority (NFTA) , to continue and accelerate the growth of Buffalo into an instrumented, 
interconnected, and intelligent city  (Figure 1.2 ). Driven by our specific needs and desired 
outcomes identified in Section 3 , the city and region, in partnership with the state, will deploy 
the “Internet of Things” (IoT) successfully to transportation. IoT is the result of the combination of devices (sensors/actuators), connectivity (broadband wireless/fiber optics), and people and information (big data). This interaction is creating new types of smart applications and services for transportation and beyond. To accomplish this mission, NITTEC and partners will instrument, interconnect, and integrate vehicles, infrastructure, centers, and communications through a system architecture that is resilient and scalable. Our holistic and integrated vision is 
presented in Section 4.  
Our approach to support a low-risk and high-payoff implementation of Smart City vision 
and concepts is presented in Section 5 . This section of the document describes a partnership-
driven open and interoperable framework that supports a digital revolution in how the city supports personal and shared mobility and that collaborates with local and state government for efficient services across jurisdictions. The identified vision and specific implementation 
approach develops the operational integration across government agencies to reduce costs, 
improve service delivery, and stimulate public-pri vate partnerships that create platforms for 
entrepreneurship, job creation, and improved transportation options and connectivity to employment opportunities for all Buffalonians.

Our vision is implemented at three levels – regional, downtown sub-area and at a corridor level.  
• A regional level, integration between vehicles, infrastructure, and centers through a resilient 
network architecture creates opportunities for synergies between different operating agencies in the region and results in new modes of public-private partnerships for traveler information. NITTEC (our grant applicant), as an operating coalition is perfectly suited to the regional integration of the IoT required for the Smart City. 
• At a downtown sub-area, we bring a natural incubation lab in the Buffalo Niagara Medical 
Campus (BNMC). Combined with the booming central business district (CBD) and other employment zones, the sub-area provides an excellent opportunity to create equitable and multimodal transportation options that spur economic growth in an inclusive manner. In this area, the Smart City application elements are geared towards supporting new and emerging models of transportation, using connected and automated technology to improve safety and 
reliability and supporting energy-efficient transportation. 
• Lastly, at the corridor-level, connected and automated technology help enable travelers and 
freight traffic in a critical bi-national corridor (I-190) travel safely and reliably especially in periods of adverse weather. 
 
Figure 1.2. The City of Buffalo’s Vision of an Instrumented, Interconnected, and Intelligent Smart City 
NITTEC will execute the vision with support from the 
partners on the Smart City team . NITTEC is an 
organization of transportation and international border-crossing agencies in Western New York and Southern Ontario, working together to coordinate transportation facilities and operations, taking advantage of new technologies as appropriate, and sharing information with each other and with the traveling public. NITTEC acts as a Transportation Management Center for the binational region, 
and the coordination of intelligent transportation systems 
(ITS) services provided by NITTEC to agencies, jurisdictions, and the general public in the region has been recognized as a model for metropolitan areas in New York State.

2. Buffalo’s Alignment with USDOT’s Desired City Characteristics 
The City of Buffalo and the proposed project area offer a scalable and replicable model for Smart 
City development for the United States. The region lies at the confluence of two Great Lakes, linked by one of the wonders of the natural world, the Niagara River and Niagara Falls. The region occupies a  strategic position on the U.S.-Canadian border
1 and on the southern edge of 
a binational region of nearly 9 million people (the third largest urban concentration in North 
America) , and it is within 500 miles of 41% of the U.S. population. The population and city 
characteristics not only meet the criteria, but are strongly geared toward adoption of the Smart City vision identified in this section. 
The following eight characteristics ( Figure 2.1 ) create a unique combination of factors that 
provide the foundation for the vision elements proposed in this application, and they align perfectly with USDOT’s desired characteristics identified in the Notice of Funding Availability. These characteristics create a low-risk and high-payoff location for a Smart City implementation that builds from the current levels of succe sses in regional collaboration and operations. 
Evidence for each of these characteristics is provided in this section.

Figure 2.1. Buffalo’s characteristics make it an ideal fit for Smart City deployment. 
Characteristic #1— A changing population with a demographic profile suited to 
adoption of new technologies and services  
Buffalo has experienced a downward trend in its number of residents in the last decades: 
• The population in 2010 was 292,648, roughly 11% less than in 2000 (U.S. Census Bureau, 
2010). 
However, affordable cost of living, reasonable 
real estate prices, a thriving university system and medical research facility, and the region’s proximity to New York City and Toronto are drawing young entrepreneurs. 
• The number of residents between the ages 
of 20 and 34––the millennials––has increased by more than 10% since 2005.  
Forecasts in the metropolitan transportation plan 
show significant growth from 2010 to 2040, especially in the area proposed for the Smart City vision elements ( Figure 2.2 ). With this 
growth has come an increased demand for housing in the downtown area. This demand and increase in urban density is illustrated by the 1,200 new residential units added in recent years and by the city’s goal to have 2,000 more units online by 2018.

The current and expected high percentage of young adults2 indicates a potentially high presence 
of a new, technologically savvy generation known as “millennials.” This generation is motivated by a need for constant information sharing, a key characteristic of a Smart City population—one that enables real-time data transfer between the system and its users.  
Characteristic #2— An evolving economy that is creating new jobs and new needs 
for sustainable transportation  
In 1970, 1 of every 3 jobs in the Buffalo 
Niagara region was in manufacturing; today, it is only 1 in 10. Meanwhile,  the 
share of jobs in health care, education, 
finance, and professional services has 
more than doubled. With more than 20 
colleges and universities in the region , 
there is a strong backbone for quality education and skills development.  One of 
our partners, the  BNMC is a self-
sustaining social enterprise successfully combining innovation, job creation, and urban revitalization. It serves as the umbrella organization of the anchor institutions that make up the quickly growing BNMC, located within the 120-acre campus 
bordering the Allentown and Fruit Belt Neighborhoods and Buffalo’s CBD (Figure 2.3). The 
city is also home to emerging biomedical research and high-tech manufacturing industries, 
providing a booming economic backbone and associated job growth ( Table 2.1 ). 
Table 2.1. Contributing Factors to Buffalo’s Evolving Economy  
Factor Characteristic Contribution 
BNMC A consortium of nine health care, research, and 
educational institutions. Located on 120 acres in downtown Buffalo, NY, it hosts 12,000 
people working and studying today, with 17,000 people 
projected by the end of 2016. 
SolarCity The nation’s largest seller of residential solar 
power. Building a plant in Buffalo, NY— adding up to  5,000 jobs 
within the next 10 years . 
Tourism/ 
Sports An industry bringing in nearly  12 million people 
on an annual basis.  Buffalo is part of the 
National Football League (NFL) and the National Hockey League (NHL). Brings in more than $2.2 billion to the economy each year. 
Buffalo will host the NHL Draft in 2016, the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association Men’s Basketball Tournament Games in 2017, and the World Junior Hockey Championships in 2018. 
 
Characteristic #3— A multimodal city with a growing shared economy that is on 
the cusp of making a meaningful impact on single-occupancy car use  
Buffalo has good history in urban planning with intrinsic support for walkable and transit-
friendly communities. From the original radial street  grid laid out by Pierre L’Enfant’s surveyor, 
Joseph Ellicott, to the park and parkway system designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, a solid 
                                                 
2 In 2010, approximately 20% of the city’s population are le ss than 15 years old, 33% between 15 and 35 years old, 
31% between 35 and 60 years old, and onl y 16% are 60 years of age or older.

urban framework has survived mostly intact. The numbers presented here highlight the 
opportunity to increase the market share of other modes of transportation, such as public transportation and non-motorized modes, if the proper investment is made to provide more efficient and dynamic multimodal services. 
Figure 2.4. System Extent and Features in Buffalo 
While the mean commute time is only 20 minutes, 30% of households do not own a vehicle. 
The public transportation system sustains 12% of commute trips, with an approval rating 
of around 90% (NFTA-Metro, 2013) . Ridership on public transit is estimated at nearly 94,000 
people a day, which translated into 10 million miles in 2014, with 26 million boardings.  
In addition to its public transportation services, the City of Buffalo supports strategies and other 
modes of transportation that seek a shift from private vehicle usage. For instance, the expansive 
campus transit network  has resulted in a 20% decrease  in car use in 5 years. Other strategies 
that have received significant support are its park and ride system , which has increased from 
11 lots to 22 lots in 2 years , and the campus bikeshare program . The City of Buffalo is a 
supporter of the Active Living by Design program, linking transportation to public health. In this sense, the city has opened 17 bike lane/path miles and has 184 miles planned , for 
approximately 73 miles of designated bikeways (on-road) and 135 of multi-use trails (off-
road)  in the Buffalo Niagara region (GBNRTC, 2010),  which has resulted in a 175% increase 
in bicycling in the City of Buffalo over the past decade . The city has also strengthened its 
commitment to bicycle transportation through its partnership with GObike Buffalo to complete a new bicycle facilities master plan in 2015 funded in part by NYSDOT and the NYS Energy Research and Development Authority.

The rideshare program has around 5,000 participants already. Carsharing has grown from 4 to 
11 cars, and Buffalo Bikeshare will grow from 70 to 250 bikes  operating in the system by the 
summer of 2016, showing that such types of programs can work with the right type of marketing tailored to small urban communities.  Legislation is under consideration to allow 
transportation network companies to operate beyond New York City.  
Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus (BNMC), Inc., established the GO BNMC Transportation 
Management Association (TMA) in late 2012 to ensure that the BNMC campus employees are served by a robust multimodal transportation system. These programs and partnerships have led 
to BNMC’s ability to help facilitate, manage, and implement more than $2,000,000 in transportation projects over the last 3 years and have served to improve access to alternative transportation options and  reduce the campus’s employee single-occupant vehicle (SOV) 
mode share by 4% in 2 years. 
The Buffalo area already has over 100 public and workplace charging stations within 
50 miles. A group led by Clean Communities of Western NY is developing and implementing an electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure plan to enable greater electric mobility in the region and between Buffalo and other parts of New York State. 
Characteristic #4— National leadership in transportation operations that 
demonstrates a proactive and regional approach to transportation  
NITTEC acts as a Transportation Management Center for the binational region, and the 
coordination of ITS services provided by NITTEC to agencies, jurisdictions, and the general public in the region has been recognized as a model for metropolitan areas in New York State. 
Table 2.2. Buffalo’s Regional Transportation Management and Operations  
NITTEC and partners are leaders in proactive Transportation Systems Management and Operations, providing national 
examples in effective regional collaboration. 
Freeways Actively managed and heavily instrumented with ITS devices including closed-circuit 
television, Dynamic Message Signs, and the TRANSMIT System. NITTEC is one of the FHWA grantees for developing an Integrated Corridor Management (ICM) system on the 
I-190 corridor. 
Border Crossings Equipped with queue warning systems and cameras to assist travelers. 
Traveler Information System Contains website and mobile app with more than 140,000 website users in 2014. 
Transit Prioritizes transit signal along Niagara Street (installation); trip planning tools; real-time 
updates; bus arrival systems; and the introduction of smart media, replacement of 
fareboxes, and installation of fare gates at underground rail stations. 
Characteristic #5— A rich data environment that offers untapped potential for 
urban analytics centered on Smart City Technology  
Through the work of NITTEC, there already exists a good flow of real-time operations data from 
ITS sensors on the region’s freeways to the Traffic Management Center for managing the daily 
operation of the region’s transportation system. The new fare collection system will also present 
a wealth of data pertaining to the trip patterns of riders, which will allow us to better plan for the 
public’s needs. In 2014, researchers from the University at Buffalo began working to create 
an integrated data warehouse, which would resolve the issues resulting from independent 
and incongruent data collection. The result was a prototype warehouse that serves to combine 
these datasets in an assessable and straightforward way. This provides great potential for an open U.S. Department of Transportation

data environment that allows for innovative public and private partnerships. All urban analytic 
and transportation simulation tools could be greatly improved by advancing Smart City 
technologies. Figure 2.5  shows some of the data related initiatives that are underway in the 
region. 
 
Figure 2.5. Sources of Data for Mobility Analytics 
Characteristic #6— A proven history of operational collaboration that showcases 
institutional capacity to undertake multi-agency projects 
Buffalo today benefits from strong working relationships between the public and the private 
entities in the region. In fact, the importance of building off of the collaborations is clearly illustrated by One Region Forward,
3 a broad-based collaborative effort to promote more 
sustainable forms of development in the Buffalo Niagara region––in land use, transportation, housing, energy, climate change, access to food, and more. The effort has recently completed a federally recognized regional plan for sustainable development. 
Existing partnerships in the region enable the transformation of Buffalo to a Smart City: 
Greater Buffalo Niagara Regional Transportation Council (GBNRTC), Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority 
(NFTA), New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT); Erie County, Niagara County, City of Buffalo, City of 
Niagara Falls, Association of Erie County Governments, Niagara County Supervisors Association, University at Buffalo 
Regional Institute and Urban Design Project (UBRI/UDP), Daemen College Center for Sustainable Communities and 
Civic Engagement (CSCCE), VOICE Buffalo, Local Initiatives Support Corporation Buffalo (LISC), Western New York 
Environmental Alliance (WNYEA), Buffalo Niagara Riverkeeper, the John R. Oishei Foundation, Buffalo Niagara 
Medical Campus (BNMC), Belmont Housing Resources for WNY, Inc. (Belmont), Buffalo Niagara Partnership (BNP), 
Empire State Development, New York Department of State, Division of Smart Growth, Niagara County Department of 
Social Services, and the Seneca Nation of Indians.
The Buffalo region is one of the nation’s leaders in transportation systems management and 
operations, operating a robust ITS system that supports the entire region. The Buffalo Niagara Binational Regional ITS Architecture is a roadmap for transportation systems integration for the metropolitan area of Buffalo, Niagara Falls, the surrounding municipalities in New York, and the Region of Niagara in Ontario, Canada, over the next 15 years. In 2014, NITTEC completed their update of the Regional ITS Architecture for Western New York and Southern Ontario. The

Regional ITS Architecture has been used as a planning tool for Regional ITS Projects involving 
multiple agencies and stakeholders, including the Peace Bridge Gateway Project and Niagara Street Corridor Project. 
Lastly, active participants of the Smart City Market Alignment for Roadway Technologies 
(SMART) Consortium—a partnership of representatives from industry, government, and academia focused on accelerating the deployment of connected and automated technologies—have all provided letters of support for this proposal including Erie County, NYSDOT, New 
York State Thruway, New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), SUNY Polytechnic Institute (Poly), University Transportation Research Center (UTRC), Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), Global Dynamic Group, SiriusXM, Cisco, and IBM. In addition, several other stakeholders have provided support letters for this application, including Buffalo Bikeshare, Erie County, GObike, BikeShare, New York State Motor Truck 
Association, the Peace Bridge Authority, One Region Forward (a regional collaborative), and 
Shared Mobility, Inc.  
Characteristic #7— A strong and engaged partnership with the research 
community that creates an opportunity for innovation, especially in the area of 
Connected and Automated Vehicles  
NITTEC, NYSDOT, NFTA, and key public sector partners are closely aligned with the research 
community, including several of them as partners in this application, as can be seen in Section 6.2 . UTRC Region II, one of the 10 funded regional research centers, is a leader in 
connected vehicle/autonomous vehicle (CV/AV) technology and has strong connections to Buffalo through one of the active members of the UTRC, University at Buffalo. NYSDOT is one of the leading states in research and development of CV technology going back to the initial deployment of the Manhattan and Long Island Test Beds for the 2008 ITS World Congress demonstrations in New York City. Since then, members of the team have been involved in the Affiliated Test Bed program. This includes managing efforts in partnership with FHWA and the ITS Joint Program Office. 
Furthermore, NYSERDA promotes sustainability, clean transportation, energy efficiency, and 
the use of renewable energy resources. Over the past decade, NYSDOT and NYSERDA have jointly funded a wide range of transportation research projects to demonstrate transportation innovations that both reduce energy use and enhance transportation system operations. The program invests $3 million per year and has funded innovative ideas in Buffalo such as carsharing and bikesharing services, Complete Streets education, comprehensive Travel Demand Management programs at BNMC, integrated corridor management planning, and the development of a regional transportation management association, among others. These projects have served as models for further deployment statewide and nationwide. 
Characteristic #8— A binational megaregion and freight corridor that creates new 
opportunities and challenges for freight and economic activity  
Sixteen percent of all U.S.-Canada trade crosses at the Niagara border. The Peace Bridge 
experiences heavy truck traffic as shown in Figure 2.6 , many of these trucks using interstates 
like I-190 and I-90. U.S. Department of Transportation

“Beyond Traffic: The Smart City Challenge” 
10 
With more than 9 million people, the 
binational megaregion is the third largest urban concentration in North America. Supporting the U.S.-Canada trade and the economic activity of the megaregion are a variety of freight facilities that span the gamut of modes (Table 2.3 ). 
While recurring congestion is not 
generally a problem for freight in the area, non-recurring delays due to weather, incidents, and construction 
are significant. Similarly, freight 
optimization between modes and ensuring reliable border-crossing times remain a priority for the region, especially with forecasted freight growth.

3. Needs and Performance Measures for Our Smart City 
Application 
Our grant application for Smart Cities is needs-driven (i.e., the vision elements are being 
proposed to solve critical needs identified by NITTEC and our partners). In discussion with our partners and stakeholders, the following 10 needs were identified as imperatives for the grant application ( Table 3.1 ). These needs guide the design of our vision and our implementation 
approach and provide the roadmap to success by defining the expected levels of performance in each need. 
Table 3.1. Our needs drive our Smart City vision. 
Core Needs Why is this a continuing need for Buffalo?  
Improving safety of traveling 
public, transit users, bicycle 
and pedestrians, freight, and 
public fleets in the City of 
Buffalo  y 1,158 incidents were observed during 2014, 67% of which were on the three major 
freeways I-190, I-290, and I-90; 44 of them were major incidents involving durations 
of more than 2 hours 
y In a 3-year period, 2009–2012, a Tri-State Transportation Campaign report noted 
3,648 motor vehicle collisions with pedestrians and bicycles in Erie County alone, 
resulting in 38 pedestrian and 5 bicyclist deaths

Table 3.1. Our needs drive our Smart City vision. 
Core Needs Why is this a continuing need for Buffalo?  
Increasing travel options for the 
general public and reducing car 
dependency in the region  y 82% of the population commutes to work by driving alone; despite recent gains, 
use of public transportation for commuting dropped significantly from 10% to 4% in the region between 1970 and 2010 
Improving access to 
destinations and jobs to select 
population groups (youths, 
disabilities, seniors) y Only 26% of Buffalo Niagara’s population lives within easy access to public 
transportation 
y Only 31% of Buffalo Niagara’s jobs are located within easy access of transit 
Reducing energy impacts of 
transportation and moving 
toward a clean energy future y Major source of energy use and environmental impacts in Buffalo is largely driven 
by vehicle miles of travel growth, which has grown per capita from 8 miles (1970) to 
18 miles (2010) a day 
Accelerating economic growth 
and job growth in the Buffalo 
Niagara region y Identified the need for continued entrepreneurship and human capital to develop 
new industries and capabilities and transition to a new economy 
y The influence of visitors to the Buffalo region is still critical to the region’s economy 
Improving freight operations 
from the border, within and out 
of the city y While recurring congestion is not a factor, non-recurring delay, freight optimization, 
and border crossings are critical needs of freight stakeholders 
Improving regional decision-
making between county, city, 
state, and Canada y As a binational megaregion with the third largest urban concentration, operational 
collaboration, regional planning, and resource sharing are priorities for the region 
Improving citizen engagement 
and satisfaction in the City of 
Buffalo y Improving the accountability of the public sector to citizens is a continuing need and 
ongoing effort by the City of Buffalo’s CitiStat program, which is entering into its 10th year of operation 
Reducing total agency cost of 
managing the system y Cost of winter maintenance including fuel, materials, and labor is particularly acute 
in a winter weather location like Buffalo 
y Aging infrastructure including bridges creates additional costs for operating 
agencies in the region 
Improving city cohesion and 
equity y With significant variations in socioeconomic characteristics in the city and the 
makeup of the urban area in Buffalo, there is a need to create solutions that lead to better integration of services, urban locations, and access to employment opportunities 
3.1 Key Performance Measures 
The following performance measures have been identified by the stakeholders and partners as 
the leading indicators of successful deployment: 
1. Increase in center-to-center communication and use of common incident-reporting 
formats 
2. Increased efficiency of commercial vehicle operations and enforcement activities 
3. Reductions in non-recurring delay (incidents, weather, construction) to truck operations 
4. Improvements in fleet management regional efficiencies due to optimization of public 
sector regulation and oversight 
5. Assessment of citizen engagement (intensity, satisfaction, influence) in system 
management, maintenance, and planning 
6. Reductions in agency cost of operations and maintenance attributed to Smart City 
elements 
7. Reductions in frequency, severity, and type of vehicle-related and bike-ped–related 
incidents U.S. Department of Transportation 
Notice of Funding Opportunity Number DTFH6116RA00002 
“Beyond Traffic: The Smart City Challenge” 
12 
8. Reduction in regional mode share for SOVs city-wide and corresponding reduction in 
vehicle miles traveled from SOV usage 
9. Increase in the range, urban frequency distribution, and quality of transportation options 
and service providers available (to current and new customers) including Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) complementary paratransit 
10. Increase in level of deployment of EVs and alternatively fueled vehicles being used in 
Buffalo 
11. Number of new firms and startups working in areas related to Smart City vision 
elements 
12. Growth in visitors and visitor spending in Buffalo 
13. Improvement in community well-being indicators in Buffalo 
Prior to the implementation, NITTEC and the team will establish a baseline for these 
performance indicators for a pre–Smart City scenario. In the implementation phase, NITTEC and partners will track their performance for these indicators and provide support to the independent evaluators identified by USDOT. Our university partners, UTRC and TransInfo, will be critical in developing a performance management and evaluation plan in Phase II of the application. 
4. A Holistic, Integrated Vision for a Smart City Implementation 
in Buffalo 
NITTEC sees the size and the scope of the Smart City application as an opportunity to make a 
transformational impact by developing an integrated “system of systems” that tackle the identified needs in a cohesive manner involving multiple agencies, private sector, and academia, as opposed to a piecemeal or siloed approach. Rather than focusing on one need, considering the Smart City concepts as a holistic framework allows the region to make meaningful progress on meeting the multiple needs of the citizens of Buffalo. Together, NITTEC sees the following outcomes for people, agencies, and the overall economy. ( Figure 4.1 ) 
Figure 4.1. Our Desired Outcomes for People, Agencies, and the Economy

“Beyond Traffic: The Smart City Challenge” 
13 
Building on the robust ITS infrastructure, to build out the physical devices in the IoT 
architecture, the team will: 
• Connect public fleet vehicles (snow plows, highway patrol, fire, ambulances, and transit 
buses) with onboard equipment that has both 5.9 Ghz Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) as well as cellular capabilities in the project area.  
• Build out roadside equipment along key arterials/intersections at downtown area and 
along key freeways to collect CV data as well as support various Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) applications using both DSRC and cellular communications.  
• Add condition monitoring sensors to bridges and key facilities along corridors. 
• Add parking sensors and availability systems in the downtown area. 
• Develop citizen reporting tools that use smartphone connectivity to directly engage with 
the public. 
The instrumentation of maintenance vehicles and buses with hybrid onboard devices capable of 
DSRC and cellular communications will drive the a dded benefits of providing greater optionality 
in data communication as technology continues to rapidly evolve.  
While physical devices are critical, center-to-center connectivity between various operating 
agencies enables regional data sharing and collaborative decision-making. NITTEC, as a multi-agency operational entity, is perfectly suited to creating a common center-to-center operating framework that brings in traffic, transit, emergency response, tollways, and maintenance. For example, planned integration with the NYS Department of Homeland Security’s Early Warning Weather Detection System is illustrative of how agencies can use common systems to become situationally aware of conditions earlier. The centerpiece of this system is the New York State Mesonet, a network of 125 weather stations across the state, with at least one site in every county. Integration with the mesonet will better help NYSDOT, cities, and counties prepare for various weather conditions. This fusion of weather data for improvements to safety, mobility, and agency efficiency has the potential to be the most powerful in the nation. 
Critical to ensuring the connectivity of these physical devices as well as center-to-center 
integration is a high-speed, high-capacity communications network that is IPv6 compatible with appropriate information technology support. Many of these expected improvements will be achieved based on the integration of certain Cisco infrastructure. Leveraging its cutting-edge “fog platform” that enables certain CV applications to potentially be stored on the network, Cisco will offer its Connected Roadways solution to support an end-to-end infrastructure that helps enable vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and V2I applications contemplated in this application. The network architecture defined for the region will factor in a security operating concept using tools like the Security Credentialing Management System. 
IBM and our university partners (UTRC Region II and TransInfo) bring national expertise in 
managing the data and developing meaningful analytics from the “big data” world that will emerge from the IoT. Figure 4.2  illustrates the overall vision for the Smart City proposal. 
Perhaps the most exciting synergy is real-time traveler information via DSRC, cellular, or 
satellite by both our public agency partners as well as our private sector partners. For example, our partner SiriusXM has a penetration rate of approximately 15% of all vehicles (and much higher in new vehicles), and this is expected to increase over the life of this program. This U.S. Department of Transportation 
Notice of Funding Opportunity Number DTFH6116RA00002 
“Beyond Traffic: The Smart City Challenge” 
14 
represents one of the most robust direct vehicle communication networks available in the market. 
NYSDOT has its statewide 511 traveler information system, and partnership through the Smart City Challenge offers increased functionality and improvements to better use the vitally important data. Not only does this partnership offer the opportunity for greater real-time traveler information, it also offers the critically important opportunity to deploy real-time routing information, basic safety messaging, and (after proper testing) three levels of sophistication of 
informing drivers of hazards such as stop signs, grade crossings, and pending bridge collisions. On the freight side, our partner Intelligent Imaging Systems brings a system with 850,000 trucks to deliver our content. The region and New York State will build off its open data/open format based on the lessons learned from 511 deployment. New York State is currently completing an integrated statewide geographic information system (GIS) as an asset for all levels of government. 
With this robust sensor and communications infrastructure in place, coupled with a “big data 
analytical” framework, the team will then begin developing the applications that meet the region’s needs defined in Section 3. These may be led by individual agencies. The next section shows how specific applications will be implemented at different levels within the City of Buffalo leveraging the IoT.

5. Implementing Our Vision: High-Level Approach 
Translating the vision into a meaningful reality for Buffalo requires a carefully planned 
implementation approach. With the expansive scope of the 12 vision elements and the multiple partners and agencies involved, the following section provides our high-level approach to realize early successes and build regional support and interest in the Smart City program.  
5.1 Implementation Elements and Levels 
It is important to determine how the various elements fit together as part of a holistic 
implementation effort. For Buffalo, three levels of implementation are defined: regional, downtown sub-area, and a corridor (I-190). Each of these levels and the vision elements included are described in the following subsections. A crosswalk is provided in Table 5-1  showing how 
the activities in each of the three levels support each other.

5.1.1 Smart City—Regional Elements 
While many of the vision elements have regional applications and the Smart City architecture 
will apply to the larger Buffalo Niagara region, the first wave of applications and field infrastructure implementation is expected to occur in a focused area that is shown in the annotated site map. The project boundary can broadly be described by the following (see Figure 5.1 ): 
• The area encircled by I-290, I-90, and I-190 
• The border crossing at the Peace Bridge 
• An extension in the northeast to include University at Buffalo North Campus 
• An extension in the east to include the Buffalo Niagara International Airport 
• Roadways just south of I-190 to include the Solar City project U.S. Department of Transportation

Figure 5.1. Annotated Map Smart City—Regional Elements 
At this geographic scope, led by NITTEC, the foundational system architecture is developed and 
standardized across the region (Vision Element #10) . 
Building from the ITS architecture, these include standardization of GIS maps, incident reporting systems, and center-to-center communication necessary for a regional operating concept defined by safe, reliable, efficient, and seamless surface transportation system. This also includes developing open datasets for use by other agencies and third-party developers. 
Secondly, the region is readied for an IoT world where a suite of validated solutions that securely 
connect disparate transportation systems to increase safety and reduce roadside incidents, improve traffic flow, and provide a centralized view of highway systems. This will support  both our corridor and downtown area deployments as well. This includes consideration of modern communication protocols like IPv6 and supports resources to keep the network running (Vision Element #11). Included in the region is a uniform emergency reporting software that will 
be used by all counties in New York State as part of NYResponds. NYResponds Mutualink, a 
new technology solution, integrates telephone, radio, video, and file sharing into one 
interoperable application. This enables local emergency staff to share seamless, real-time

information with the state and other counties. This is another example of consolidating and 
integrating services across and between jurisdictions—an inherent requirement for the IoT 
(Vision Element #11). 
In addition, regional approaches can leverage individual agency resources to achieve shared 
outcomes for several vision elements: 
• An increase in the adoption of expedited clearance programs and systems (such as single 
oversize and overweight systems, border clearance) by the entire region can create efficiencies not only for the agencies but also for fleet operators (Vision Element #6). 
• Electronic integration of snow and ice removal systems to coordinate NITTEC Traffic and 
Operations, City of Buffalo Department of Public Works (DPW), Erie County DPW, New York State Thruway, and NYSDOT winter response is a strategy supported at the regional level (Vision Element #5). 
• Optimization of freight travel including drayage is possible at the regional level between 
various intermodal facilities by sharing data feeds with freight-relevant information. Our partners include the New York State Thruway Authority, NYSDOT, Intelligent Imaging Systems, and Voyage Control, who will play a major role in defining the applications at this level (Vision Element #6). 
• Shared monitoring of regional assets such as bridges, pavement, and ITS equipment using 
real-time sensors (both fixed and mobile) across the region will lead to efficiencies in asset management practices and decision-making (Vision Element #3).  
Some user-focused mobility services also exist at this level for regional traveler information 
needs, especially through open data and partnerships that bring regional partners together:  
• Early warning systems and wide-area traveler dissemination through partners like SiriusXM 
and others.  Such wide-area dissemination may be used by travelers in the region to alter trip 
decisions and actively manage demand, including balancing the load at the various border crossings and also during emergencies 
(Vision Element #5). 
• Human service transportation coordination 
based on travel management coordination 
center concept for one-stop shop for  disabled and senior transportation services 
(Vision Element #5). 
• Support for enabling integrated trip planning and traveler information services between 
different services in the area (Vision Element #5). 
• Joint purchasing of infrastructure in the region.  
Urban analytics and performance measurement at this level provide input to regional planning 
and performance management. Supported by our partners in TransInfo and IBM, several analytic 
tools will be added to the region to take advantage of the new data capabilities in the region. Such tools may include winter maintenance performance measurement and route optimization, evacuation and diversion modeling, and real-time multimodal performance dashboards for the region (Vision Element #4) . Summary  
Proposed regional elements create the foundational 
tools necessary for resilient, low-cost, secure 
architecture that is interoperable across the region. By 
leveraging these elements, new regional applications 
for travelers and agencies are proposed that improve 
incident and emergency response, improve notification 
to travelers, and support efficient frei ght movement. U.S. Department of Transportation

NYSERDA’s efforts to expand the market for EVs are tied closely with the state’s efforts to roll 
out a smart electric grid. National Grid, the main utility in Buffalo, is a strong partner and is very interested in both vehicle electrification a nd ways to integrate vehicle charging, grid 
communications, and grid controls. Through this application, there is an opportunity for Buffalo and National Grid (Vision Element #8)  to lead in: 
• Implementation of new options for on-bill payments for public charging stations, innovative 
methods for encouraging cars to charge at hours when electric grid use is low, battery-backed charging stations that reduce demand spikes, and innovative business models for deploying public charging stations. 
• Continued growth in EV integration in the carsharing fleet, providing low- and moderate-
income communities with access to clean cars. 
• New partnerships between charging station network owners and carsharing companies, and 
more (Vision Element #8). 
Lastly, at a regional level, the City of Buffalo will continue its award-winning citizen 
engagement programs4 and enhance existing tools to support innovative engagement practices 
for winter weather management and work zone management (Vision Element #9). 
5.1.2 Smart City—Downtown Sub-area Elements 
A core downtown area has been identified for the implementation of several of the vision 
elements with a focus on developing a multimodal, shared, and highly energy-efficient sub-area within Buffalo. The Smart Sub-area focuses on BNMC, Buffalo’s Innovation Commercialization Hub in the Central Business District (CBD) where IBM is located, and also includes some of the 
most economically vulnerable neighborhoods on Buffalo’s East Side. In many of these 
neighborhoods, the census tracts close to half the families live in poverty and, of the 23,100+ higher-paying jobs existing in the community, only a small fraction—1 out of 10—are held by residents in Buffalo (east of Main Street). 
Toward the eastern boundary of the map lies the Larkin District employment hub and the Solar 
City employment complex to the south. The additional neighborhood geography and the important employment centers to the east and south of the CBD are included to promote greater equity and job access opportunities for residents through Buffalo’s Smart City initiative. 
At this implementation level, connected and automated technology  elements in our framework 
are deployed including (Vision Element #1 and Vision Element #2) : 
• A cooperative vehicle-infrastructure DSRC-based situational awareness system, to be 
developed at key intersections to support bicycle and pedestrian safety applications as shown in the adjoining figure. 
• NFTA buses operating in this corridor, to include advanced crash avoidance systems using 
Mobileye’s Shield +TM driver assistance safety technology. 
• Transit signal priority along key arterials in the downtown area for NFTA buses.

• Pilot deployment of low-speed automated shuttles that operate within the BNMC campus area 
to provide first- and last-mile connectivity to transit. 
Figure 5.2. Downtown Sub-area for Smart City Implementation 
Supported both by real-time data on conditions and historical data on travel demand and preferences, at this level, the emphasis on mobility services and innovative travel options will be led by our partners BNMC and the City of Buffalo.  
BNMC is a natural incubator of Smart City concepts. The BNMC fosters conversation and 
collaboration among its nine member institutions, its partners, and the community to address critical issues impacting them, including energy, transportation and parking, workforce development, and healthy communities, with the overarching goal of increasing economic development and building a stronger community within and outside its campus. BNMC is 
undergoing rapid growth over the next 5–20 years, and sustainable planning, energy efficiency, 
and mobility management are critical to managing this growth.  
Specific vision elements implemented at this level include: 
U.S. Department of Transportation 
Notice of Funding Opportunity Number DTFH6116RA00002 
“Beyond Traffic: The Smart City Challenge”  
 22  
• Completion of BNMC Mobility Hub to support shared-use mobility and alternate 
transit options:  This will serve as the TMA headquarters and transportation resource center  
where employees and nearby 
residents can come to learn about and sign up for various services and programs (including carsharing and bikesharing) at a centralized location (Vision Element #5 
and #7).  
• Development of a BNMC 
“Change Lab”:  This will be 
an outlet for partnership, 
implementation, and monitoring/evaluation of innovative transportation solutions in an urban environment, such as those being researched and developed by the UB Institute for Sustainable Transportation and Logistics, including autonomous and connected vehicles 
(Vision Element #7).  
• Integrated Transportation Fare System 
(Smart Card):  BNMC and partners will 
integrate various fare collection and access control systems among transportation and parking services on the BNMC. The program will serve as a step toward the creation of a more efficient and user-friendly multimodal transportation and parking network, while also providing new data resources for use in analyzing, planning, and implementing future transportation services, policies, and programs 
(Vision Element #5). 
• BNMC Parking System Development:  The 
BNMC TMA is also responsible for the management of the BNMC Parking System, currently composed of more than 4,700 parking spaces, with construction of a new 1,800-space garage soon underway. BNMC will work with the city and local leaders to explore the use of active parking management strategies for better management of on-street parking spaces in the area, including residential permit programs, parking sensors, and the use of mobile technologies 
(Vision Element #3 and #5). 
• Accessible Transportation Technology Implementation:  To ensure that the benefits of 
technology are equitably available, NFTA and partners will develop advanced wayfinding  
Figure 5.3. Schematic Showing a Cooperative Vehicle-Infrastructure 
Situational Awareness System for Bike-Ped Safety in Downtown 
Summary  
At the downtown level, the emphasis will be on making 
multimodal travel safe, fun, and efficient. By using 
connected vehicle technology to prevent bike-ped 
crashes, using automated shuttles, and enabling public 
and private partnerships for travel options including parking, the outcome of Smart City elements at this 
level will be an increased mode share for non-SOV 
modes and improvements in safety and energy use. 
All of these elements contribute to the enhancement of 
downtown as a business and residential hub, and they 
increase connectivity between different neighborhoods 
in this area, leading to a spurt in economic investments.U.S. Department of Transportation

technology that enables persons with disabilities to effectively hail and use transit  (Vision 
Element #5).  
• Intelligent Streetlighting: Upgrading to LED streetlighting is becoming a statewide priority 
in New York cities. A series of NYS-supported programs and regulations are making this easier to accomplish starting in 2016. While these upgrades are being completed, they provide a great opportunity to enhance Buffalo’s smart infrastructure by installing one of the many new LED streetlighting products that incorporate a range of sensing and communication technologies. This could be a great avenue to more affordably implement a smart parking system (Vision Element #8).  
In addition, initiatives in this sub area championed by BNMC includes a strong energy-efficiency 
focus.  Specific vision elements that can be supported by the Smart City application include: 
• Fruit Belt Neighborhood Solar Project . a National Grid REV Demonstration supported by 
the BNMC, Inc. that seeks to engage and benefit the neighborhood through the installation of 
(100) residential PV systems on a sub-set of homes, which would be screened through both a combined structural/roofing and solar viability assessment and comprehensive home energy audit conducted by local contractors. 
• BNMC Community Micro-Grid .  The BNMC Inc., its member institutions develop an 
Energy Innovation Plan  that supports economic development and growth in the greater 
Buffalo Niagara Region.  The plan integrates demand management, energy efficiency, grid modernization, alternative transportation and renewable energy to develop the campus and surrounding areas as a self-sustainable energy hub (Community Micro-Grid) able to offset utility outages or natural disasters enhancing reliability and resiliency. 
• Smart Grid Network Operations Center (NOC) . Provide a platform for BNMC member 
institutions and adjoining community members to optimize their energy flexibility based on individual priorities with respect to reliability, cost, and sustainability while actively coordinating their collective distributed energy resources (DERs) in a market that compensates them for providing such system benefits. 
• Energy Efficiency . The goal for construction of the new garage is to meet Green Garage 
Certification standards, including but not limited to accommodating additional EV charging stations on the campus (currently there are 22), additional secure bicycle parking, and use of light-emitting diode (LED) lighting. (Vision Element #6) . 
• Integration of EV charging into parking management . Tying EV charging networks like 
ChargePoint into broader smart parking systems would help EV drivers plan their trips better and feel more confident in their ability to get a charge when needed. Smart parking system deployment could also provide an opportunity for lower-cost EV charging station rollout if there is a conduit being laid or solar photovoltaic installed to bring electricity to infrastructure in parking lots or on-street (Vision Element #8) . 
5.1.3 Smart City—I-190 Corridor Elements 
NITTEC and partners are currently working on an ICM plan for major facilities in the Buffalo 
Niagara region. The corridor includes all the major freeways in the region and encompasses the City of Buffalo. For the Smart City implementation, a portion of this larger network, the I-190 corridor, will be identified as a priority.  U.S. Department of Transportation 
Notice of Funding Opportunity Number DTFH6116RA00002 
“Beyond Traffic: The Smart City Challenge”  
 24  
The I-190 corridor includes a major interstate that leads to an international border, has adjoining 
arterials with transit service, and is heavily in strumented with fixed ITS detection. All of these 
characteristics make it an ideal starting location for implementing Smart City elements. When successful, these elements can be easily transitioned to other corridors like I-290 and I-90. 
In this corridor, NITTEC and partners plan to deploy a complementary set of CV 
communications capabilities to the downtown area. This will include the necessary number of DSRC Roadside Units and vehicle instrumentation to support a variety of CV functions. The architecture would allow the vehicles to communicate with other vehicles, intersection components, and back office systems using a variety of communication mechanisms (DSRC, cellular, and satellite). Safety-critical applications  (e.g., V2V collision avoidance and intersection 
status) would occur over 5.9 GHz DSRC. Other applications that are less time-critical would use Wi-Fi and cellular. 
Figure 5.4. I-190 Corridor for Smart City Implementation 
Using the flexible CV architecture, NITTEC and partners will develop the following priority 
applications to start the program (Vision Element #2):  
• Connected vehicle telematics data collection for 
road condition reporting system on the corridor, which can be shared as part of regional traveler information and third-party applications. 
• Use of existing deployable road weather 5.9 GHz 
DSRC application to provide in-vehicle alerts and advisories for adverse road conditions. 
• Connected vehicle enabled situational awareness for work zones and school zones. 
Summary :  
At our corridor level, connected and automated 
technology is widely used to improve the situational awareness of both the traveler and the agency. By using connected vehicle data and 
road weather management, work zone 
management can be improved, which are two 
critical areas for Buffalo.  U.S. Department of Transportation 
Notice of Funding Opportunity Number DTFH6116RA00002 
“Beyond Traffic: The Smart City Challenge”  
 25  
• V2I applications for wrong-way driving and over-height warnings for trucks approaching 
bridges. 
In addition, snow plows operating on this corridor will be equipped with driver assist 
technologies that use a combination of sensors and Global Positioning System technology to provide feedback and displays to help operators keep on track with their snow plow operations even when they cannot see the road (Vision Element #1).  
Lastly, this corridor will benefit from the full suite of ICM technology including a corridor-based 
decision support tool that allows for coordinated incident response, route diversions, and other 
control strategies. ICM is jointly funded by USDOT/NYSERDA and includes a simulation component that provides NITTEC a determination of near-term traffic impacts for their use in management of the incident (Vision Element #5).  
5.2 Sustainability and Scalability of Vision 
NITTEC as the lead agency for the program is responsible for the continued capability maturity 
of the Smart City framework. NITTEC and partners believe that implementing the plan as described in Section 4.3 would take us from an opportunistic level, where there are multi-agency partnerships emerging, to a managed level, where technology and data-enabled dynamic services deliver tangible improvements.  
As a regional agency, NITTEC is able to work across agency and jurisdictional boundaries, 
enabling the scalability of the applications and the Smart City infrastructure to other corridors (I-290 or I-90) fairly easily. NITTEC and partners through its governance structure and the committee membership will continue to build on success toward an optimized level, growing from the downtown sub-area to a city-wide open “system of systems” that continually adapts and grows to meet changing citizen expectations and is resilient to economic changes and to disasters. 
5.3 Managing Technical, Institutional, and Programmatic Risk 
NITTEC’s strong oversight through the management structure described in Section 6 mitigates a 
lot of the programmatic risk. As a complex program with many moving parts, the role of the Smart City working committee to establish a yearly work plan greatly improves program management of this effort.  
Secondly, the team’s realistic approach to vision elements and context-sensitive application of 
solutions to corridors, sub-areas, and regions allow us to manage the technical risks to the Smart City program by decomposition of the program elements into manageable implementation activities. By focusing on the base layers of the technology at a regional level, interoperability and scalability across corridors and sub-areas are maintained. By keeping the focus on the corridors and sub-areas, applications can be developed to target highly local conditions such as employer mix, weather, and land-use patterns. 
Lastly, the working coalitions and history of collaboration between agencies and partners in this 
application coupled with the support from highest levels of agency leadership allow us to mitigate the institutional risks.  U.S. Department of Transportation

6. Technical Capability to Successfully Implement Our Approach 
The Smart City grant application and the subsequent implementation will be carried out by a 
committed group of public, private, and academic partners with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. The following sections highlight the governance, roles and responsibilities, commitment, and local resources available for this project. 
6.1 Clear Management, Governance and Decision-making Approach 
NITTEC as the grant applicant will be responsible for setting up a management, governance, and 
decision-making approach to the Smart City Challenge. This role is well suited to NITTEC, a coalition agency that works together with the member agencies to coordinate transportation facilities and operations, taking advantage of new technologies as appropriate, and sharing information with each other and with the traveling public. 
NFTA acts as a host agency to NITTEC. This arrangement was formalized in an agreement 
between NYSDOT and NFTA for supporting coalition activities and the operation of the Traffic Operations Center. In addition to providing office space, NFTA provides administrative services 
to NITTEC. 
NITTEC’s governing structure consists of a Board of Directors and eight committees. The Board 
of Directors can establish additional standing or ad hoc committees and/or project teams for specific tasks. For the Smart City Challenge, NITTEC will set up a Smart City committee that includes representatives from all existing committees as well others necessary for the governance of the program. The Smart City committee will be responsible for the program development and implementation oversight of the Smart City program elements as shown in Figure 6.1 . NITTEC 
would structure the Smart City committee following the existing NITTEC committee model, which has been in place for more than 20 years. The committee would develop a mandate and a yearly work plan; meet on a regular schedule and develop a plan to progress on the initiatives that were defined at the startup of the committee; and build consensus from the members on the 
initiatives. 
The program development activity will create a phased approach to implementing the framework 
described in Sections 3 and 4. Program element implementation activities will be undertaken under the leadership of the public and private partners. The Smart City committee will be responsible for ensuring that all program element implementations are sequenced correctly and implemented in line with the Smart City vision.

6.3 Demonstrated Commitment from City, State, Private leadership 
As noted in the introduction, the grant application and the Smart City vision elements described 
in Section 4 have the commitment of the state, city, county, and NFTA. Committed partners include private sector representatives who have been actively involved in putting together this grant application. Letters of support are provided in Appendix A.  
6.4 Additional Available Local Resources to Support Smart City 
Implementation 
Our application elements as described in Sections 4 and 5 are highly local. Our private and 
academic partners are currently active in the City of Buffalo carrying out several Smart City–related initiatives already. Their roles are desc ribed in Section 6.2. In addition, there are a few 
emerging initiatives with great promise to be leveraged for our Smart City program. These include the following: 
• The $5 billion Clean Energy Fund, to be administered by NYSERDA, builds on the progress 
the state is already making in developing a robust clean-tech sector. Of the $5 billion, $717 million is allocated to innovation and research. The fund will help spur innovations through research and technology development that will drive clean-tech business growth and job creation while providing more energy choices to residential and business customers. This is of direct relevance to Vision Element #8.   
• NITTEC manages a Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) established to support and enhance 
innovation and development of solutions to improve mobility in the region. There is approximately $4,958,000 in available monies for regional ITS, operations, and mobility projects for loan through the NITTEC RLF. Based on the established guidelines, loans are available for member agency sponsored organizations that wish to pursue project funding in the region in accordance with the established Project Selection Criteria and could potentially support Smart City program elements. 
• Through the leadership of the UTRC Region 2 and SUNY Poly, the SMART Consortium 
strategy was launched in 2014 and now serves as one of the premier platforms to align leading industry experts, university researchers, and government officials to support the sustainable development and deployment of connected and autonomous vehicles.  
• NYSDOT/NYSERDA is funding a truck platooning planning study. Upon the study’s 
completion and feasibility assessment, there may be potential interest in testing concepts at a deployment site in New York State, adding to the automated technology elements proposed in the application. 
• NITTEC and ITS elements are included in the MPO Metropolitan Transportation Plan and 
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP). Annual operating costs for NITTEC as well as capital projects are financed through the TIP process. 
7. Summary 
NITTEC sees the size and the scope of Smart Cities as an opportunity to tackle multiple needs 
simultaneously and holistically. Through our vision described in Section 4 and our approach described in Section 5, we are ready to take on the Smart City Challenge. Recognizing that transportation is the lifeline that opens up nearly every opportunity from attending school to U.S. Department of Transportation

getting to work or receiving life-saving medical care, NITTEC and partners view the Smart City 
application as a catalyst to create a stronger, more equitable Buffalo economy through a 
connected and engaged citizenry. 
Buffalo’s merits as an ideal 
Smart City location derive from not only the demographic characteristics, but also from the successful history of regional collaboration. As one of the nation’s leaders in regional systems management and 
operations, NITTEC is an 
ideal grantee to support the Smart City program, which is intrinsically a multi-agency framework of action. 
Our carefully selected team of partners brings local champions; public, private, and academic 
expertise; and a passion for the digital revolution promised by the implementation of the Smart City elements. NITTEC and its partners recognize the wide range of benefits that come from realizing the vision for an instrumented, interconnected, and intelligent city for local agencies, citizens, and the overall economy, and our application is strongly supported by all levels of government in the region as evidenced by letters of support in Appendix A. 
Our approach described in Section 5 is driven by a strong sense of practicality and clear focus on 
the desired outcomes and performance. Our emerging governance and management approach clearly shows how a multi-agency implementation will be managed.  
All these factors make Buffalo a low-risk and high-payoff location. As a location for Smart 
Cities, our successful implementation in Buffalo will serve as a model for how using the power of technology and connectivity starts a digital revolution that changes the way we understand our systems, and how they work and interface with each other. By unleashing the power of connectivity, automation, and integration, Buffalo seeks a future of shared prosperity by all residents through regaining its leadership position in innovation not seen since the turn of the 20th century when iron, coal, and hydro-electricity turned the region into an industrial giant.

1.0 City of Riverside Vision for Smart City 
Home to deep water marine ports, a highly developed network of roadways and railways, an 
extensive concentration of warehousing distribution facilities, and one of the most sought-after 
local consumer markets, Southern California is the largest goods movement gateway to the 
country. Southern California provides 40% of the nation’s total import  traffic and about 25% of 
its total exports – more than any other state. The City of Riverside sits at a critical through-point 
in Southern California, as the City is bound by major freight corridors including: SR-60, SR -91, I-
215, and I- 15 and is a conduit of goods and people between the ports and the rest of the nation . 
Currently, the County of Riverside ranks as the fourth fastest growing county in California. 
 
As the largest city within Riverside County, Riverside is a key component of the Inland econom y 
for Southern California. With an estimated population of 320,000 (2014), densification of 
housing, four expanding universities, increases in local & regional industrial development, 
increased BNSF and UPRR trains, and over 400 signalized intersections, the City of Riverside is 
exemplary of the current transportation dilemma faced by many urban cities. As a result of the 
tremendous amount of economic activity and associated travel in the area, and also partly due 
where Riverside is situated in the Southern California air basin, Riverside has a long history of 
dealing with air quality issues, suffering from some of the worst air pollution in the country dating 
back to the 1960s. However; with aggressive air quality regulation primarily aimed at the 
transportation sector, pollutant emissions have been reduced by as much as 90 percent over the 
last half century. More recently, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are now being aggressively 
targeted in the region to deal with climate change issues. The State of California has already taken 
steps to restructure environmental guidelines to de-emphasize the addition of vehicular capacity 
as environmental mitigation- an effort in which Riverside has been an active participant. The 
opportunity to re-envision Riverside as a Smart City will bring relief to congested roadways, 
reduce emissions, encourage mode-shifts, improve safety, allow for City policy changes to 
parking requirements and land uses, and significantly enhance the quality of life of our City’s 
residents and patrons. 
 
Riverside’s proposal is to develop a Radial Open & Automated Data System (ROADS)  to build on 
Riverside’s existing transparency and community data engagement efforts , and expand radially 
across boundaries, including enterprise, geopolitical, and jurisdictional boundaries.  Riverside 
already shares millions of records, mapping data, and tabular citywide statistics through its 
Engage Riverside web portal – much of the shared statistics are updated every five minutes by 
the system and are readily integrated into third party applications. An expanded broad and 
encompassing approach allows a new class of solutions and is a step change in the reach and BEYOND TRAFFIC: SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
City of Riverside, California - Application

value of the data. Information is shared with all of the key stakeholders within the community – 
not just the government agency that traditionally creates and manages the records. Smart Cities 
will require Open Data to span public and private domains, platforms and services.  Moreover 
the scale and reach of data ROADS will need to process is far beyond anything done before and 
will be closely coordinated with oversight and regulating agencies. 
Riverside has identified five  locations, including several City-owned properties, for the 
construction of Single Points of Transit (SPOTs) , both large and small, to serve as regional, 
university, and neighborhood hubs for rail, automated neighborhood electric circulators, bus, 
bike share, electric vehicle rental, and shared economy transit services. These facilities would be 
linked to ROADS, and allow residents, students, and businesses within the City to capitalize on 
the intelligent improvements generated by the demonstration project. Riverside is also currently 
managing grant funded studies of a connected streetcar network, and an initiative to incentivize 
large-scale mixed use developments near major transit facilities. 
 
Addressing the next generation of urban challenges does not require overhauling entire cities. In 
fact, Riverside’s  approach to smart cities improves resource management by adding connectivity 
and intelligence within the existing physical infrastructure and strategic-partnerships as a 
baseline.  The proliferation of inexpensive sensors and SCADA headend systems provides 
significant opportun ities for cities to share information and transform the transportation 
industry.  This new sensing pattern, commonly referred to as the Industrial Internet of Things 
(IIoT), allows cities to begin a transformation period to integrate and develop the following 
elements: 
 Utilize increased data availability to transform relationships between agencies, 
stakeholders, businesses, academia, regulators and the public. 
 Enable people beyond typical SCADA/Information and Communication Technology (ICT) 
Engineers to utilize sensor data. 
 Encourage users t o ask questions, innovate, drive economic and social development, and 
generate data to augment SCADA/ICT engineers. 
 Share local and regional real time driving information via various devices including 
phones, vehicles, changeable message signs, kiosks, and smart devices. 
 Produce volumes of data orders of magnitude greater than what typical enterprise 
software handles today, and leverage this data for innovation, social and economic 
development, and sustainable outcomes. 
 Improve commutes and decrease delays by integrating real time information to optimize 
traffic signal systems, automated transit, and provide users with choices on travel routes 
and travel modes. 
The value of ROADS is the ability to integrate data from all of the critical infrastructures/services 
a City must provide. Riverside will integrate the transportation sector seamlessly through the 
following key principles: BEYOND TRAFFIC: SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
City of Riverside, California - Application 
 
 
 
Page | 3  
 
Interoperability 
True efficiency will result from t he integration of  city functions such as energy, water, waste, 
lighting, transportation and built infrastructure – enabling intelligent communication, while 
maintaining security protocols and data stewardship.  Smart Cities are comprise d of all of the 
critical service providers to a city, be they  publicly or privately owned.  Disruptive events amplify 
the interdependence of these critical municipal services.  ROADS will be the infrastructure these 
critical functions use to share data , and as a result:  reduce  energy usage, improve situational 
awareness and security, and increase overall sustainability and reliability.  
 
Cross Jurisdictional Sharing Information 
Cities, Counties, State, Municipal Planning Organizations and Federal Agencies have different 
roles and responsibilities to perform within local jurisdictions. Local, state, and federal agencies 
strive to share information but often policies, security protocols, networks, and communication 
systems restrict data sharing. Software can now enable us to synchronize traffic signals and 
timing while monitoring lane level traffic patterns and emissions so that new electric and 
automated vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians can move throughout our city and respond to 
customer demand in real-time.  
 
Processing at the Edge 
Critical physica l infrastructure  including transportation networks , video detection cameras, and 
signal  control systems produce massive amounts of real -time data.   Our proposal  support s 
adding processing power and intelligence where data is transferred and received – enabling 
information to be more intuitive and dynamic. ROADS  will be  designed with the flexibilit y to 
expand and scale.  
 
Smart Transportation 
The City of Riverside’s  goal is to enhance safety and convenience for the next generation of 
connected vehicles and infrastructure through our smart transportation solutions that leverage 
ROADS. ROADS will integrate real-time congestion data, direct wrong way driver alerts and 
accident response management, provide emergency action plans to the City’s Emergency 
Operations Center, reduce CO2 emissions through traffic management, and process location 
finders for parking and electric vehicle charging stations . With this approach, our communities 
will be able to increase adoption of lesser used modes of transportation including commuter rail, 
busing, cycling, car-sharing, bike-sharing, and last mile solutions like Uber and Lyft.  
 
2.0 City Characteristics 
The City of Riverside’s population characteristics fully align with t he USDOT’s characteristics for 
the Smart City Challenge Program, including: 
a. Our population of 303,871 based on the 2010 Decennial Census. BEYOND TRAFFIC: SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
City of Riverside, California - Application 
 
 
 
Page | 4  
b. Our Dense Urban Population was 3,731.0 people per square mile (Riverside has a total 
area of 81.4 square miles). 
c. 15.7% of the City’s population is representative of the Riverside -San Bernardino local 
urbanized area (1,932,666 population). 
3.0 Other City Characteristics 
Incorporated in 1883, Riverside is a Charter City in the State of California with a unique blend of 
historic charm and modern city features. While rich in history, Riverside has invested billions of 
dollars in infrastructure improvements to serve residents and businesses well into the future. 
Riverside is currently served by 20 Riverside Transit Agency routes, both Metrolink and Amtrak 
rail services, and a new 24 mile Metrolink extension & station expected to be completed within 
the next month.  
Riverside’s City Management enthusiastically supports the pursuit and execution of the Smart 
City project, the City’s success as an award -winning municipality demonstrate both the continued 
singular vision of its leadership, and the traits that make Riverside an ideal landscape for the 
Smart City project. The City is ranked #1 among all Inland Southern California cities in virtually 
every economic indicator; including number of jobs, number of businesses and assessed 
valuation. Some of the recent awards and recognitions that Riverside has received include: 
Number 1 City for Small Business by Inc. Magazine (2014), Number 2 Millennial Boomtown in 
America by Forbes (2014), Number 8 Coolest City in America by Forbes (2014), Number 1 for Job 
Growth in 2013 (ASU), Number 2 Spot for Tech in the United States (2013), 2012 Intelligent 
Community Site of the Year, 2011 Can-Do City (Newsweek), and First Emerald City (2009) . 
Riverside is home to many legal, accounting, brokerage, architectural, engineering and 
technology firms as well as banking institutions. The University of California, Riverside, California 
Baptist University, La Sierra University, and Riverside Community College, offer specialized 
training, research partnerships, and a high-technology environment to support emerging and 
innovative companies. 
The Ci ty’s Single Point of Tr ansit (SPOT) plans demonstrate a commitment to integration of the 
sharing economy with traditional modes of transportation. Engage Riverside, a web portal 
maintained by the City,  provides open source data updated every five minutes that can be used 
by application builders. Riverside would continue its commitment to open data as part of the 
Smart City demonstration.

5.0 Holistic Approach to USDOT Vison Elements 
The City of Riverside continually augments and updates its transportation system . The City’s 
state- of-the art Transportation Management Center (TMC), a citywide reliable traffic signal 
communication network, centralized traffic management system that integrates over 200 traffic 
signals, an d a parking management system that makes use of smart metering are just some of 
the enhancements that the city has incorporated to improve safety, mobility, accessibility, and 
the environment. The City has developed a proactive Active Transportation Progra m which 
includes 160 miles of bicycle facilities to link major transportation centers with their local 
universities, employment centers, downtown, and residential neighborhoods.  
In order to provide a holistic approach to smart transportation, there are a number of underlying 
technologies to integrate: 
 Connectivity  - cost effective and persistent network-wide wireless connectivity.  
 Data Platform  - common backend data platform and format for collection, display, control 
and analysis.  
 Control and Automation  - the entire transportation network should be integrated with 
control and automation holistically.  
Once data is made available through ROADS, each vision element can be wholly analyzed and 
operationally optimized to enhance the transportation network.   
Automated electric vehicles would reduce GHG emission burdens on the network.  As such, Vision 
Element #1 (automated vehicles) and Vision Element #8 (electrifying roadways) are highly 
synergistic.  If the parking spaces can rapidly charge automated vehicles while they are parked, 
the battery size of the electric vehicles can be reduced.  In addition, vehicle range is extended 
and the driver experience improved to make electric vehicles even more appealing. 
The Electrical Grid is managed and owned by the City of Riverside . Data from each critical 
infrastructure element will enable the analytics and optimization in a “system” thinking 
approach.  Automated, connected vehicles on roadways with charging capabilities (Vision 
Elements #1, 2 and 8) are the baseline for smart transportation.  Vision Elements #5 and # 6 are 
extensions of this approach, and give citizens mobility choices while exploiting unused capacity. 
Intelligent sensors and information/ communications technology (Vision Elements #3 and #11) 
form the basis of data and analytics enablement.   Citizens (Vision Element #9) will benefit from 
the information provided, while the urban analytics (Vision Element #4) will find a home to feed 
the information into the system. 
Partnership and interoperability standards are essential for bringing innovative technology into 
reality.  Our approach to smart transportation relies on re-imagining and re-using existing BEYOND TRAFFIC: SMART CITY CHALLENGE

infrastructure where possible, make them smart and multi-purpose; and providing cost-savings 
and efficient opportunities.   
Vision Element #1: Urban Automation 
City of Riverside Vision  
The City of R iverside proposes  opportunities to enhance mobility, accessibility, safety, and the 
environment by integrating auto mated  vehicles along specific corridors and within the 
downtown area; it will be linked to other transportation corridors, transportation centers, 
universities, and commercial areas.  
 
The Riverside Team will work closely with the California Partners for Advance d 
Transportation Technology (PATH) program . The  Riverside team plans to apply vehicle 
automation, e.g. precise train -like curb parking to its transit service. For years the City of 
Riverside has been pursuing a  connected, intelligent  streetcar system on key arterials , 
including University and Magnolia Avenues . A partially automated bus rapid system offers 
improved service  pursuing more advanced automation for the City’s transit system, which 
will also include shared -use vehicle systems.  
 
Critical Objectives : Auto mated  City Transit Vehicles  
 As part of the Smart City Program, the City w ould  provide automated transit in the 
Downtown area. Downtown Riverside alone hosts over one million visitors per year. 
The Festival of Lights, hosted by the historic Mission Inn, attracted an estimated 78,000 
visitors to the downtown on opening day, and 480,0 00 visitors over the course of the 
month long festival . The downtown hosts multiple annual events, which cumulatively 
attract another half million visitors. The Courts system hosts nearly 100,000 jurors each 
year, while the newly -remodeled convention cente r hosts approximately 120,000 
visitors per year.  
o Fixed route auto mated  bus services can be provided a t low speed locations to 
reduce the complexity of purely autonomous systems.  
o Slow moving auto mated  neighborhood electric vehicles  will enhance mobility 
in the downtown area. It will reduce vehicle and parking demands; allowing 
people to hop on and off the system.  
 Auto mated  right -sized City  buses can be easily integrated by:  
o Using analytics to determine ridership throughout the day t o send proper size 
bus – full bus, van size or passenger vehicle . 
o Using sensors at bus stops to alert more real time pick -up.  
o Provide automated transit as part of the City’s Single Point Of Transit initiative.  
o Trip planning including real -time traffic information and route analysis can be 
provided to commuters to facilitate their trip planning and modes of 
transportation . BEYOND TRAFFIC: SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
City of Riverside, California - Application

 Shared -use electric vehicle systems previously developed and deployed in Riverside 
(see http://www.cert.ucr.edu/intellishare.html ) will be expanded and integrate 
auto mated  technology.  
o Riverside would allow collector roads with 7 -ft or greater bike lanes to 
accommodate Neighborhood Elect ric Vehicles (NEV).   
o Riverside will deploy shared -use electric vehicles in conjunction with charging 
infrastructure, auto mated  corridor(s), and smart grid energy management.  
 Connectivity enablement between auto mated  vehicles, traffic conditions, electric grid 
state, etc.  
 Riverside will integrate  Dedicated Short Range Communications  (DSRC ) radios along

Building on existing strong strategic -partnership  between the City of Riverside and UCR, 
the Riverside Smart City vision will greatly expand its Urban Analytics efforts in three key 
directions:  
1) Traffic Monitoring:  The City of Riverside has proactively set up video cameras across 
the city to monitor traffic, including key rail crossings. Video feeds from this camera 
system are currently used by City forces  at Riverside’s Traffic Management Center (TMC)  
and the City’ s Emergency Operations Center . These  video feeds will also be analyzed using 
advanced computer vision tools to automatically determine traffic counts, speed, density, 
and flow rates throughout the city. In addition, safety applications will be developed to  
automatically determine potential safety hazards at key rail crossings.   
2) Electric Grid Management:  The City of Riverside is in a unique position in that it owns 
and operates its own public utilities, Riverside Public Utilities (RPU, see 
http://www.riversideca.gov/utilities/ ). RPU and UCR are working together to better 
monitor and manage its electric grid using advanced sensors, data collection techniques, 
predictive models, and energy storage. As a testbed system, RPU and UCR are using the 
Hunter sub -station grid to deploy various micro -PMUs (Phasor Measurement  Units) across 
the system.  
3) Real -Time Energy and Emissions Estimation:  Using the City’s real-time traffic data and 
transportation figures from  other providers, UCR has developed a technique to estimate 
energy consumption and emissions  from a variety of roadways. This technique was 
originally developed as part of the USDOT Sustainability Working Group in which basic 
safety message data from vehicles are monitored and fed into a real -time 
energy/emissions model. As a result, estimates of  roadway link -based energy and 
emissions are possible. This is valuable for determining greenhouse gas emissions 
inventories  and fuel consumption . Riverside will expand this effort as a Smart City.

6.0 Risks and Mitigations 
The City of Riverside is fully committed to all the requirements that will be defined under the 
Smart City Challenge Program. If selected, one of the first tasks of the program is to develop a 
Risk Management Plan that will address risks and mitigations for each vision element including 
additional tasks associated with the program.  It is anticipated that the Smart City Program will 
face risks associated with integrating existing legacy technologies with emerging technologies, 
sharing of Open Data and protocols, institutional policies, and environmental policies. Further 
changes to local, state, and national requirements due to integration of connected, automated , 
and automated vehicles, also pose risk to the project. A Risk Management Team will be created 
from our public-private partners that will be responsible to identify, rate, and develop alternative 
mitigations and solutions that will be presented to the City of Riverside and the USDOT Team. As 
part of the Risk Management Plan, the Riverside Risk Management Team will develop a 
framework for each vision element that will include the type of risk and associated mitigation 
and/or solution. The Risk Management Plan will be a dynamic element, and will continually 
address risks and mitigations throughout the entire program. In addition, the City of Riverside 
will provide a Quality Assurance/Quality Control Team that will develop Quality 
Assurance/Quality Control Plan and Processes as necessary for each proposed mobility solution. 
It will provide check and balances to the Smart City Program, and it will minimized the number 
of risks to the Program. 
7.0 Partnerships and Stakeholders   
For the Smart City Program, the City of Riverside is prepared with robust strategic-partnerships 
with city departments, local government agencies, local businesses, transit agencies, planning 
organizations, technology companies, vehicle manufacturers, freight industry, ride-sharing 
companies, bike-sharing companies, academia, and professional associations, to support 
development of advanced and innovative smart city solutions. Partnering with globally 
recognized academia, auto industry, and private sector firms will bring worldwide expertise on 
the rapidly changing technologies, standards, and applications. The City of Riverside has a long, 
strong, and extensive strategic-partnership program with the University of California, Riverside. 
The Smart City Program will enhanced our partnership and will allow us to work together on all 
aspects of the program. In addition, the City of Riverside Team is partnering with other local, 
state, and national universities to provide additional support and collaboration, including 
University of California, Berkeley – California PATH, California Polytechnic State University, San 
Luis Obispo, and California Polytechnic State University, Pomona. In addition, The Ohio State 
University will serve as a collaborator to our academia team. The City of Riverside has reached-
out to public and private sectors, including globally recognized companies that can bring smart 
city business portfolios for each vision element. We have over 20 private-partners in the Riverside 
Team - including Qualcomm, BOSCH, Microsoft, Volvo, INRIX, AirSage, and others. We have 
invited other technology companies and automakers, including Mercedes Benz and Toyota, and BEYOND TRAFFIC: SMART CITY CHALLENGE

they have agreed to explore teaming opportunities with the City of Riverside upon a final award 
has been made by USDOT. A complete list of our strategic public-private partners and their 
anticipated support on the vision elements are highlighted in the Appendix.  
 
8.0 Existing Transportation Infrastructure 
The City of Riverside maintains 870 miles of urban roadways, 155 of which are considered arterial 
routes. Alessandro Boulevard, a major East/West route within Riverside, carries approximately 
65,000 vehicles-per-day (VPD). Van Buren Boulevard – which runs parallel to Alessandro 
Boulevard, carries an additional 60,000 VPD. Magnolia Avenue, which runs parallel to State Route 
91, carries over 30,000 VPD on its busiest segments.  State Route 91, State Route 60, and 
Interstate 215 all pass through the City of Riverside, totaling 21 miles of freeway facilities. These 
freeway facilities are major goods movement corridors serving the Port of Long Beach and Port 
of Los Angeles. The City of Riverside is served by two commuter rail-lines (Metrolink), one Amtrak 
route, and is nearing completion of a new Metrolink Station to serve the Perris Valley Line 
extension, a 24-mile route that will establish Riverside as a hub between neighboring cities to the 
east and lines that extend to other inland and coastal cities. Riverside is also served by the 
Riverside Transit Agency (RTA), the Riverside Downtown Terminal is a hub for 15 major routes 
and 2 inter-county routes. In addition to its published routes, RTA offers dial-a-ride services. Both 
the University of California, Riverside and California Baptist University’s campuses off er ZipCar 
services to provide students with on-demand vehicles. The City is currently in receipt of grant 
funding to implement a Bike-Share Program that will link downtown businesses and attractions 
to a full-service location located at the Downtown Metrolink Station. The Bike-Share Program is 
already planned for expansion following the successful implementation of the first project phase. 
The City’s ambitions for construction of large Single Point of Transit (SPoT) locations as major 
transit hubs would integrate shared services such as Uber and Lyft and be configured to for 
continual adaptation to the changing transportation landscape.  
 
The City of Riverside has an extensive Ethernet fiber-optic communications network deployed by 
the Riverside Public Utility (RPU), and additional infrastructure managed and installed by the 
Public Works department dedicated solely to the Traffic network. The City’s Traffic network is 
comprised of over 20-miles of copper hardwire cabling, spread-spectrum radio installations, a 
Citywide Wi-Max 5ghz range radio deployment with three major access points, fiber-optic cable 
installations, and a planned 10.5 mile fiber-optic cable backbone. This major fiber-optic route will 
be used as a conversion point for existing serial lines, and will be fitted with access points to 
enable radio communications in locations previously deemed to have poor reception on the 
City’s Wi -Max network. The major fiber-optic installation will also tie in to the fiber optic cabling 
on Caltrans’ State Route 9 1, to enable direct communication with the Caltrans Traffic 
Management Center (TMC). The City’s state -of-the-art TMC currently displays video feeds of 
major intersections, at-grade rail crossings, and Caltrans web feeds. The City has deployed over 
30 dedicated CCTV installations for traffic management, and additional CCTV deployments for 
law enforcement, building services, and parks & recreation. Riverside maintains over 400 traffic BEYOND TRAFFIC: SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
City of Riverside, California - Application

signals. The City of Riverside’s Public Utility has made use of Smart Meter ing features since 2010. 
25 Electric Vehicle charging stations have been deployed within the City of Riverside, the most 
recent of which is a pilot installation to test next-generation charging technology. This new 
deployment uses the mobile application, “Greenlots” which allows users to access additional 
chargers in the area and coordinate payments for charging. Both the City and UCR monitor 
charging station use as part of a collaborative effort.  
 
9.0 Data and Analytics 
The City of Riverside manages a wide array of data relevant to transportation, including: accident 
records, service requests, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, vehicular count and speed data, and 
video camera recordings. The City collects and publishes millions of public records, fire responses, 
permit activity, crime reports, and neighborhood and services mapping data. The City’s Public 
Works Department retains records pursuant to City Council resolution 21774 and CA Code 34090.  
Transportation data collected can be correlated with the rem ainder of the City’s databases to 
improve emergency response times, automatically develop detour routes for new street opening 
permit applications, manage the flow and queueing of goods movement vehicles, inform 
placement of new land uses, and monitor business trends related to traffic flow within Riverside. 
Video data collected through CCTV traffic cameras is also used to facilitate law enforcement 
investigations, and has a positive impact on public safety; enhanced video capabilities would 
further the efficacy of traffic cameras which can double as safety tools. Conversely, data collected 
regarding the use of City facilities, emergency services, and development can be used to shape 
the expansion of the City’s ITS network and inform the strategic placement and routing of 
automated / high quality transit services. As part of the Smart City Program, the City of Riverside 
would significantly increase its transportation data collection efforts, and endeavor to build on 
existing data sharing relationships with regional partners to bring in outside sources of data to 
enhance travel within the City and region. The City recently installed a GridSmart camera unit – 
which has the capability to tie in to V2I hardware, record signal phasing information concurrently 
with video data, and generate unique models for each entity passing through the video stream. 
Under the Smart City Program, the City would pursue widespread installation of enhanced video 
technology for data collection purposes and sharing additional information with our partnered 
agencies to improve mobility in the City and the region.  
The City has existing strategic-partnerships and memorandums of understanding (MOUs) in place 
with our local transportation agencies, including the County of Riverside, Caltrans District 8, and 
the University of California, Riverside to facilitate the sharing of transportation information, 
including:  As part of the State Route 91 HOV project, the City is completing a physical connection 
to the Caltrans District 8 fiber optic communication network – which will provide the City with 
access to State Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras and output data from the State highway 
system. Currently, the City also hosts six District 8 interchanges on the City’s central traffic 
management signal system – QuicNet, and has an existing MOU to add an additional interchange. BEYOND TRAFFIC: SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
City of Riverside, California - Application 
 
 
 
Page | 25 
Data output from State highway facilities can be used to augment signal timing and operations 
along key corridors within the City of Riverside and it allows our partner, Caltrans, to manage 
operations of their freeway facilities. The City’s existing agreements with Caltrans District 8 place 
restrictions on the modification of traffic signal data, and existing options within Riverside’s 
central traffic management system make the restriction of such data simple. The City is also 
working with Caltrans District 8 to establish an inventory and map of deployed ITS technologies 
within Riverside and surrounding agencies in an effort to create smart inter-agency corridors that 
will bring relief to the congested state highway system, improve safety and mobility. 
The City of Riverside’s agreement with the County of Riverside allows for sharing of video feeds 
at shared intersections through use of a VPN connection. The City of Riverside has a committed 
strategic- partnership with the University of California, Riverside (UCR). The City’s partnership 
allows UCR to collect data related to DSRC V2I communications installed at City’s intersections 
via remote vehicular access, and direct supervised physical access to the traffic signal controllers. 
Aspects of UCR’s Science Perimeter Network can be integrated into ROADS –  which allows for 
high-volume data transfer, remote experiment control, and data visualization. The City of 
Riverside has separate partnership agreements with UCR through the Public Utility to share 
information regarding its Electric Vehicle charging stations. Currently, the City has partnered with 
Riverside Transit Agency (RTA) as part of the Bus Rapid Transit Pilot Program along Magnolia and 
University Avenues, and traffic signal data collected by the City has been used to update traffic 
signal priority timing and technologies. Each existing strategic-partnership with our local 
transportation agencies and UCR allows the sharing of transportation data and technologies. In 
addition, our strong strategic partnerships and MOUs allows for future expansion of data sharing. 
In addition to the City’s existing strategic -partners, the City will team with major transit service 
providers such as Amtrak and Metrolink to provide ridership information to travelers at 
transportation centers, including transportation information and choices.  In addition, the City 
will request and assist with the development of real-time data from rail services, along with 
Riverside Transit Agency, to provide travelers with up- to-date transit options. The City has further 
plans to share traffic data with emerging transportation data providers such as Waze and Apple; 
along with shared transportation companies, including Uber and Lyft.  
By serving as the central point for such key public-private partnerships, the City of Riverside can 
coordinate the collection and distribution of real-time open data for all modes of transportation, 
providing a significant benefit to the users of each potential travel mode. As with its existing 
partnerships, the City of Riverside will be mindful of the safety and cyber security implications of 
any data shared, and ensure that relevant security measures are taken to prohibit malicious or 
unintentional harmful impact on the operations of any City facility and the users. The Smart City 
Program will be used to fund technologies that maximize open data input and sharing, and used 
in the full extent possible to enhance existing public-private partnerships while fostering new BEYOND TRAFFIC: SMART CITY CHALLENGE

public-private relationships to improve mobility, improve safety, reduce congestion, protect the 
environment, and provide economic growth in the City and region. 
 
 
10.0 Standards and Architectures 
The City of Riverside Smart City Program and initiatives shall conform to the National ITS 
Architecture, the Connected Vehicle Reference Implementation (CVRIA) and associated SET-IT 
software tool, and published and under-development ITS standards and processes to 
demonstrate interoperable ITS capabilities.  As part of the City of Riverside Smart City Program, 
the City will develop a Smart City Strategic Plan describing the City’s goals and visions and specific 
framework for each vision element. At a minimum, it will identify applicable standards and 
architectures, public-private strategic- partners, applicable policies, users’ needs, strategic 
opportunities, strategic initiatives, safety, security, implementation, operations requirements, 
performance measures, risks and mitigations, innovative features, emerging interoperability 
technologies, solutions, applications, quality assurance and quality control procedures, etc. to 
maximize the overall benefits of the Smart City Program. A Smart City Strategic Team will be 
created from our public-private partners and they will be responsible to develop and maintain 
the City’s Vision Element Strategic Plan and will work with technology developers to improve the 
quality of products based on lesson learned deployments. 
 
11.0 Measurable Goals and Objectives 
The City of Riverside proposes to develop measurable goals and objectives for each element of 
the City’s vision. As part of the City’s Smart City Challenge Program, the City will develop a n 
overall Concept- Of-Operations (ConOps) and System Engineering Plan that incorporates each 
Vision Element. The plan ’s measurable goals and objectives for each vision also will be integrated 
as a systematic City approach to monitor the impact of the demonstration on mobility, safety, 
efficiency, sustainability, and climate change. The plan will identify a set of targeted performance 
measures related to the each component of the proposed deployment. Several standard tools 
are available for evaluation as performance measures at intersections and corridors in the City 
of Riverside. In addition, our partners at UC Riverside have developed unique performance 
measures and tools that can be applied for key mobility and environmental applications. By 
providing real-time feedback, these tools will improve the efficiency, mobility, and safety 
throughout the City.  
 
Performance measures will include: wait time, percent arrival on green, vehicle delays, V/C ratios, 
turning movement counts, red light violations, Purdue Coordination Diagrams (PCDs), traffic 
energy consumption per mile, and total traffic GHG and pollutant emissions per mile . In addition, 
The Riverside Team will also provide Automatic Traffic Signal Performance Measures (SPMs). 
These SPMs metrics will show real-time and historical functionality at signalized intersections, 
allowing the City to measure what they previously could only model. Accurate real-time decision-
making on signal performance and timing will help signal management personnel identify 
malfunctions in vehicle and pedestrian detectors . This cost effective solution will also measure BEYOND TRAFFIC: SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
City of Riverside, California - Application 
 
 
 
Page | 27 
vehicle delay and the volume, speeds and travel time of vehicles. The City can use these metrics 
to identify operational deficiencies, optimize mobility,  and help manage traffic signal timing and 
maintenance.  
 
Evaluating traffic signals helps reduce congestion, save fuel costs and improve safety. SPM’s are 
based on high-resolution data  recorded on a 24 hour/7 day, cycle- by-cycle basis using an 
embedded controller data logger. To develop the performance measures, high-resolution data 
are necessary. The City’s communication infrastructure is foundational to the SPM system 
followed by traffic signal detection. The SPM system is vendor neutral and uses open-source 
software. The City of Riverside welcomes and supports any USDOT independent evaluation of 
system performance with respect to the targeted measures, to collect or infer contextual data 
that allows for the isolation and mitigation of confounding factors, and to provide supplementary 
evaluation with respect to a broader set of safety, environmental, mobility and public agency 
efficiency measures of interest to USDOT. The City will allow access to the project locations, 
project team, and to conduct evaluation-related experiments, interviews, and surveys. 
 
12.0 City Capacity for Implementation 
The City of Riverside is very proud to have strong collaborative partnerships among civic, cultural, 
educational, and business leaders; and our City Leaders are committed to provide top quality 
transportation services to residents, businesses, and visitors. Our City Mayor Mr. Rusty Bailey, 
Council Members, City Manager, Managing Directors from Public Works, IT, and Public Utilities 
Departments are very familiar of the magnitude of the Smart City Program and have pledge full 
commitment to take the Smart City Program as the top priority for the City of Riverside. Our 
existing strategic partnerships with UCR, Caltrans and local agencies will bring resources with 
different expertise to the Smart City Challenge Program. In addition, UCR and Advantec 
Consulting Engineers are contributing partners on the grant’s application and UCR has pledged 
support to implement and manage the project’s data, milestones, and grant performance. 
Riverside is located in Southern California and the City envisions working with local government 
agencies, local businesses, transit agencies, planning organizations, technology companies, 
vehicle manufacturers, freight industry, ride-sharing companies, bike-sharing companies, 
academia, professional associations, and various other stakeholders to incubate and deploy 
advanced technological applications to meet evolving transportation challenges.   
 
If selected, the City will develop a Program Management Plan describing our public-private 
partners, man agement teams, specific work plan/task associated with each element and team, 
anticipated project schedules, and additional management tools that will be necessary for this 
Program. The City of Riverside has the capacity, planning, engineering and support personnel, 
and experience to take on large projects. In recent years, the City has successfully managed, 
designed, and/or constructed over 15 large transportation projects that collectively have 
exceeded $580 million. In addition, the City has successfully worked with federal, state, and local 
agencies in grant delivery, management, and performance reports. Many of the City’s grants have 
required partnerships and collaboration with local agencies, stakeholders, and neighborhood BEYOND TRAFFIC: SMART CITY CHALLENGE

groups. The City employs planners, surveying, and transportation, traffic, and wastewater 
engineers. In addition, the City owns the electrical and water public utilities in the City and 
employs electrical and clean water engineers to support those services and would be available 
to assist with this project. Most of the engineers employed by the City have engineering design 
experience and are familiar with local, state, and federal guidelines. The Public Works 
Department is actively working with the Public Utilities and IT Departments to share fiber optic 
communication facilities to share bandwidth and make traffic signal communications more 
robust and reliable. The City, Inland Region, and Educational Institutions recognize the unique 
and landmark opportunity being offered by the Department of Transportation with the Smart 
City Challenge Program and have pledged full commitment at the executive level to ensure its 
success . The City has an infrastructure that would facilitate deployment of technological 
advanced applications and programs including: 
 
1. A robust IT Network that was recognized when City was named “World’s Most Intelligent 
Community, which includes copper, radio, and fiber optic lines of communication. 
2. Riverside owns its own water and electrical public utilities which would facilitate 
specialized communication applications. 
3. Riverside employs a strong Traffic Engineering and Signal Maintenance Division that is 
equipped to work ITS Technologies and communications. 
4. Fiber-optic communication backbone. The City is working with Caltrans, to provide 
communication redundancy through use of the Caltrans network. 
5. State of the Art Traffic Management Center. 
6. Three Freeway Systems that traverse the City and the State would support the Smart City 
Challenge Program. 
7. BNSF and Union Pacific Railroad traverse the City and have numerous at-grade and grade 
separated intersections that could test railroad safety applications as part of a safety 
monitoring program. 
8. City will have the longest Railroad Quiet Zone project.  
9. Three major universities reside in Riverside, including UCR which employs scientists and 
engineers at the Bourns College of Engineering Center for Environmental Research and 
Technology (CE-CERT).  
 
13.0 Opportunities to Leverage Federal Resources 
Riverside is actively managing and in pursuit of several grant-funded projects totaling over $25M 
that would directly augment the efficacy of the Smart City Program. Riverside was recently 
awarded Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) funds – which will provide, in addition to 
pavement friction improvements at several locations citywide, the installation of new pedestrian 
HAWK signals, and the re-coordination of Central Business District traffic signals along with the 
purchase of new CCTV equipment. Procurement of ITS technologies from this grant will be 
forward-thinking; CCTV cameras purchased for the downtown will have the potential to integrate 
with V2I and data collection technologies. The City will also be installing several additional HAWK BEYOND TRAFFIC: SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
City of Riverside, California - Application 
 
 
 
Page | 29 
signals as part of two rounds of Active Transportation Program (ATP). The ATP’s primary use is 
the installation of citywide pedestrian and bicycle improvements to enable and foster an active 
lifestyle for Riverside residents within disadvantaged neighborhoods through the installation of 
bike lanes, Bicycle-Share Programs, and HAWK signals. The HAWK signals as part of both ATP and 
HSIP funding are strategically located at locations with high volumes of pedestrian travel. These 
locations are ideal for smart kiosks to provide transportation information and options to 
residents, in addition to their intended crossing safety benefits. The new HAWK signals will be 
tied to Riverside’s ITS network, and have the potential to be augmented through Smart City 
funding.  
Riverside is currently deploying the first stage of the BNSF and UPRR Quiet Zone project – which 
will provide advanced pre-emption services for many at-grade crossings within the City. Rail pre-
emption and data recording equipment installed as part of Quiet Zone installations is significantly 
more sophisticated than a traditional railroad pre-emption, and could be relayed to the Smart 
City’s network to alert motorists and automated transit services of potential delay at crossings.  
The Riverside Planning Division has several efforts underway to better integrate land use 
development and transportation, many of which use or plan to use grant funding. The City is 
currently fulfilling a State grant to study the feasibility and potential benefits of a Streetcar 
System. The study considers alignments, ridership, physical constraints, along with the land use 
economics analysis required to identify full streetcar costs and funding sources. The streetcar 
feasibility study is expected to be completed summer of 2016, and will include detailed analysis 
of value capture and property assessments strategies. Implementation of a streetcar alignment 
within Riverside would promote alternative transportation, and would readily tie in to Smart City 
Program. Riverside Planning also received a grant from the Western Riverside Council of 
Governments (WRCOG) to prepare a Transit Oriented Development Framework Plan for 
properties near the Downtown Metrolink station. The Framework Plan will coordinate the 
objectives of the City, County, transit agencies, and private property owners, and create a 
development vision that coordinates transit infrastructure, vehicle circulation, pedestrian and 
bicycle corridors, parking resources, and land development constraints. Implementation of this 
framework by developers will attract residents who are inclined towards the use of alternative 
transportation, and are likely to be participants in the Smart City infrastructure. The City is also 
working to create a land use & transportation initiative that would encourage private 
development projects to incorporate multi-modal hubs, known as Single Points of Transit 
(SPOTs). The SPOT program is currently identifying high priority sites within Riverside that are of 
a size to accommodate private development of a complementary retail, office or residential uses. 
Outside of the SPOT program, Riverside can maximize new development’s participation in the 
Smart City Program.  BEYOND TRAFFIC: SMART CITY CHALLENGE

The Governor’s Office of Planning and Research is currently in the process of retooling the 
California Environmental Quality Act guidelines to shift from the improvement of vehicle Levels 
of Service (LOS) as environmental mitigation metric to the reduction of vehicle miles traveled 
(VMT) – which provides the City an opportunity to enhance the Smart City Program, including 
performance measures. For example: in order to mitigate a development’s VMT impact, Riverside 
could require the development’s integration  of V2I technology in to a company rideshare 
program, or pay towards the addition of ITS equipment at impacted locations. Riverside will 
maximize the potential from our extensive strategic partnerships with the public and private 
sectors, including - city departments, local government agencies, local businesses, transit 
agencies, planning organizations, technology companies, vehicle manufacturers, freight industry, 
ride-sharing companies, car-sharing companies, bike-sharing companies, academia, and 
professional associations. Our academia and private partners have a rich history of successfully 
conducting large scale technical demonstrations, evaluations, and real-world implementation of 
transportation technologies and smart city solutions. Our strategic public-private partners have 
pledged resources, including staff expertise, in support of the City of Riverside Smart City 
Program.

 Summary  
The U .S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) has developed a challenge to address “how  
emerging transportation data, technologies, and applications can be integrated with existing 
systems in a city to address transportation challenges.  The USDOT is looking for bold and 
innovative ideas to fund demonstration projects that would test, evalua te, and demonstrate 
the significant benefits of smart city concepts. ”i 
According to the challenge Notice of Funding Opportunity, the submitted proposals should 
“demonstrate how advanced data and intelligent transportation systems (ITS) technologies and 
applications can be used to reduce congestion, keep travelers safe, protect the environment, 
respond to climate change, connect underserved communities, and support economic vitality. ”  
This proposal from the City of Scottsdale, Arizona (further referre d to a s the ‘City ’) illustrates  
the high -level vis ion and goals the City  has for a 21st century smart, connected, and complete 
transportation system and what a demonstration proj ect would look like for the City .  The 
proposal will provide a framework relative to  the prioritization of  the Vision Elements and the 
eight (8) potential major p roject demonstration test areas .  The City  has already instituted , over 
the last twenty -four (24) months,  a dynamic and open discussion on recognizing the role 
transportation pla ys in preserving livable neighborhoods, promoting economic vitality , 
responding to 21st century safety, efficiency, and mode choice needs to ensure Scottsdale, 
Arizona remains a world class destination for residents and visitors  alike .    
This challenge wi ll be a fantastic addition to an already forward  moving effort that has involved 
participants such as  residents, the Mayor, City Council, City staff, City Transportation 
Commission, and business leaders working together on complex transportation problems faced 
by the City .  This partnering will become  even more  evident as a City of Scottsdale 
Transportation S ummit is scheduled for early summer.  
Thoughtful disruption is underway  nationwide , especially as it relates to technology adoption 
and the role technol ogy plays in the evolution of smart transportation .  The idea of accelerating 
emerging technologies that have the potential to transform the C ity’s transportation  system is 
captivating .  The  last few years have seen the City already trending toward a smart  government 
and transportation operations  approach.  The City transportation d epartment in particular has 
been adopting progressive approaches to collect ing a nd analyzing data, communication  and the 
use of  social media and mobile pla tforms, and discussing how connected , semi -autonomous,  
and autonomous  vehicle technologies  will affect the City  in the near future .  The City of 
Scottsdale, Arizona wants this opportunity in order to further transportation opportunities for 
our citizens and visitors and particip ate as a national thought leader on these evolving topics.

 PART I – VISION NARRATIVE  
Introduction  
Scottsdale, Arizona is known for its exceptional Sonoran Desert experience and is a premier 
southwestern United States tourist destination.  The City’s neig hborhoods have a long history 
of fostering outstanding livability through healthy and sustainable communities .   
Paramount to continuing this tradition  is developing a smart, connected, complete surface 
transportation system that addresses all -modes  and, all contributing infrastructure, across all  
demographics, for all users.  The deeper success of these efforts is further measured by how 
that system incorporates those with limited mobility options which includes , but is not limited 
to people without vehicl es, students, people with disabilities and seniors . 
The City is bordered by the Arizona Department of Transportation  (ADOT)  State Route (SR) 101 
to the east and north  (currently undergoing a $100 million general purpose lane addition for a 
maximum 25% capa city increase) ; ADOT’s SR 202 , Arizona State University, Valley Metro Light 
Rail to the south; and Phoenix, Arizona - the sixth largest city in the nation - 1,488,750 people to 
the west.ii  The City’s transportation system contains  324 street  segments and 2 03 street 
interse ctions  (System M ap – see last page ).  A recent City survey concluded over 70 % of those 
living in Scottsdale work elsewhere, over 80 % of people working in Scottsdale reside elsewhere, 
and almost 20% live and work in the City.iii 
As smart publ ic sector initiatives advance across the nation the private sector is also doubling 
down on technology that  can transform entire industries.  These technology provider 
companies have now identified transportation as an environment ripe for transformation .  
These transformative technologies: cloud and mobile computing, conn ected devices, the 
Internet of T hings  (IoT) , virtual reality, big data and machine learnin g, advanced robotics and 
drones are the center piece of what’s  now possible in  extracting transpor tation system 
performance .   
Comparably, t houghtful disruption is also underway inside  transportation o perations in 
connection with asset management planning, sustainable transportation program 
implementation, resilience design engineering, climate change data downscaling, Level of 
Service needs -based budgeting;  transportation system management and operations (TSMO), 
and a whole host of growing connected vehicle systems and architectures, and advanced 
transportation and congestion management technologies.   Scottsdale , itself,  has been adopting 
and shif ting to a smart transportation/ smart government framework for more than two years.  
Utilizing a mix of innovative policies, proactive energy, and transformative reform – especially 
in the transportation divisi on – the ultimate goal has been to achieve  a transparent, engaged, 
data -driven environment to deliver transportation services people actually need, and quite 
honestly expect.   3 
 Specific to the City’s transportation  evolution  and the notion of smart, connect ed, complete 
systems, a lot of work exists in orchestra ting the complex interplay of data,  cameras, sensors, 
devises, applications and the system users.  With the gr owth of IoT,  these dynamic interactions  
are growing in possibility.  With the addition of  this dynamic interplay of multiple nodes and 
multiple applications , the information  can now be harnessed into user f riendly decision making 
tools.  While advances such as software -defined networking (SDN), open application 
programming interfaces (APIs), and  5G LTE wireless are progressing , it is big data analytic s and 
cloud storage that looks to lead the transportation systems build  out.  This type of opportunity 
to disseminate  large amounts of data unveils  the possibility  to truly blend user interactions, 
capacity and trip segment solutions , and modal choice efficiency into a progressive  21st century 
multimodal system.   Specific to the City,  this would be an environment w here all data from  all 
modes operating within the  system can be gathered , transmitted , processed , and subsequent ly 
determinations and commands sent back .  This return interaction reaching both the City 
operations staff, the system itself, and to the intelligent devices  of the user , all in real or near 
real time, really turns the transportatio n system into a digital nervous system - constantly 
scanning for efficiencies  and user feedback .  
To further add to the mix,  the C ity of Scottsdale, Arizon a sits at the nexus of this disruptive 
transformation in transportation.   The City could hardly be i dentified as suffering from 21st 
century ills .  But, therein  lies the problem.  This has presented a serious number of 
transportation issues to solve  stemming from the hyper -grow th Maricopa County has 
experienced in  the last two decades , the City’s own deve lopment, and the transportation 
system infrastructur e life -cycle deterioration rates .  As a result, the  downtown area parking has 
reached capacity;  numerous streets  segments  are at or over capacity;  changing user a nd 
demographic expectations; and connectiv ity demands to the wider Mari copa County system 
have expanded .  These  issues will not be solved by traditional plan, design, build, operate and 
maintain approaches.  In addition, the citizens, visitors, business owners, conventio neers, 
seniors, urban youth , and  those with disabilities are no longer willing to accept a transportation 
system that is overrun by cars with  limits on complete streets, multimodal  solutions,  and 
technological advancements .  
The reality is the City’s transportation system that has b een in place for much of the last forty 
years is reaching maximum utilization  using currently available industry standards .  The bui ld-
your -way out approach is no longer viable .  More importantly, the City has a long history of 
bold action when it comes to  solving problems.   However, today’s financially constrained 
transportation  environment , economic development  pressures , and residen t and visitor 
expectations have raised the problem solving complexity.  The 2015  Scottsdale, AZ: Elevating 
Excellence, Promo ting Prosperity  report – adopted by the Mayor and City Council under 
Resolution 9750 was a wakeup  call.iv  It highlighted the complex nature running today’s city 
governments.  4 
 Looking back further, i n May 2013, the Scottsdale City Council was already initiat ing an 
organizational strategic planning process that builds on the legacy of previous work and studies 
to drive and align the City Government’s activities and investments toward key priorities.  The 
Organizational Strategic Plan was formally approved in D ecember 2013, and affirmed the 
following strategic goals for the City Government:v   
 Value Scottsdale ’s Unique Lifestyle and Character   
 Support Economic Vitality   
 Enhance Neighborhoods   
 Preserve Meaningful Open Space   
 Seek Sustainability   
 Advanc e Transportation  
The 2015 report  reiterated the need to act on the 2013 strategic goals.  It  stated “the prospects 
for the City’s future economic development competitiveness and stature are unparalleled.  But 
just as all that Scottsdale is today is reflect ive of generations of hard work by its elected 
officials, public management, citizens, and business and civic leaders, all that Scottsdale can and 
will become requires even greater strategic vision and more arduous work because the proven 
methods of what w orked in the past are dramatically different than those that drive economic 
growth and prosperity in today’s globalized world.”   
The 2015  report references transportation eight times over sixt y-pages.  T hose  eight references 
are mentioned in the following  context: a s a strategic goal, as an economic development 
priority, as an opportunity, as a threat (what a lack of action could do), as an employment 
source under two categor ies, and as a  strategic component  to the two million square feet of 
commercial spa ce in use at the Scottsdale Airpark.  The Airpark in particular is identified as 
creating $3 billion per year in economic spinoff activity.     
Thus began a new chapter in the City’s transportation system and a call to action from the 
people passionate abou t the City’s transporta tion needs .  The  Scottsdale, AZ: Elevating 
Excellence, Promoting Prosperity  report in particular spurred the Scottsdale Transportation 
Commission  (TC) into action to seriously overhaul its charter, contributing use , and ultimat e 
driver in reinventing how the City’s transporta tion system would work into this century.  The TC 
started with a cross-platform thinking  approach  with a progressive transportation movement 
centered on three pillars:  Service, L eadersh ip, and Community  Engagement .  See update to City 
Council P.13 http://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/Asset58082.aspx .   
It is important to note that the movement of technology in relation to shifting modal choice  
and user interface  does not exist in a vacuum.  The  simultaneous shift in tec hnology in the auto 
industry  is driving change in  how people and cities interact with the automobile, and for all 5 
 intents and  purposes , this shift will be with us as part of the  multimod al landscape f or year s to 
come.   New technologies - electric vehicles, advanced propulsion, autos linked to the Internet, 
advanced safety systems  - are arriving in cities and are  fundame ntally changing  the way we 
drive and forcing cities to react and  adapt.   
 
To sum all  this up, you have to consider all aspects of technology, government, citizens, and the 
auto legacy into reinventing a transportation system.  For the City, this was simply further 
opport unity for thoughtful disruption, using a cross -platform approach, and  an agreement that 
without all participants no matter what their views, this evolution would not happen.   
 
To be awarded round one funding is very timely and will give the City the r are opportunity to 
leverage five very specific actions ; 
 
 The City  is well  underway to finalizing the next City General Plan  
 
 The City  is nearing completion of the next Transportation Master Plan  
   
 The City  community leaders , after a long dormant period in discussing transportation , 
have joined the tidal wave of progressive tra nsportation change  
 
 A complete redevelopment and utilization assessment of the City’s fixed route transit, 
free trolley system, and adoption of a high capacity transit vision is all being undertaken.  
 
 Most important, the citizens, visitors, business owners , conventio neers, seniors, urban 
youth, and  those with disabilities have all voiced a desire to participate in developing 
that next vision.   
 
The City of Scottsdal e, Arizona is an ideal site due to its  continuity of committed leadership, 
authority, and ca pacity to carry out the d emonstration project throughout the period of 
performance and continue operation after the period of performance is over.  The City  is a 
separate and i ndependent city, has a central business dist rict, maintains existing, robust , and 
advanced transportation infrastructure that includes  ITS equipment , an existing traffic 
operations center (TO C), and share d use transportation options.

velocity of data.   
 Disadvantaged multi -modal t est case - Vista del Camino Community Center  and Granite 
Reef Senior Center .  The potential to review mode to mode interaction between the two 
sites will aid in the developm ent/improvement of efficiencies or lack thereof associated 
with public transit in the area. Understanding individual user and demographic behavior 
relative to transportation will be invaluable to the system as a whole.  
 System user interface and c hange dri ver behavior through navigation tools and socially 
responsible gamification .  “Incentivizing user engagement by appealing to a sense of fun 
and competition” and crowdsourcing to “assess the practice of obtaining needed 
services, ideas, or content”vi  Provid ing an interactive platform in which the user in real 
time may utilize to determine more socially responsible preferred routes, ultimately 
elevating system stressors.  
 Signal preemption impacts and how smart data and infrastructure could be deployed 
and ma naged through the TOC . A special interest in the idea of satellite bus availability 
that could be deployed in real time due to system interruptions to the transit user  and 
the City’s 203 transportation intersections   
 Further exploit the interplay of bike/p ed technology and user interface in relation to the 
entire system and all modes  connectivity with a particular fo cus on data analytics of the 
in-development City bike share program.  
 Paratransit, fixed transit , and trolley routing creating enhanced mobility  for aging 
populations .  
 Further evaluate system constraints through traditional auto system load leveling and 
signal prioritization utilizing data extracted at all 203 street intersection  and V2V and

Element #4 will utilize current, previoiusly synthesized data and analyics to formulate w here 
information gaps are prese nt. Th en, t he goal will be to develop new Big D ata sets to 
complement the existing data sets and gaps.  
The team with also explore and tes t the data sets across the four 
areas :
 
 
 
 
Element #3 would require the team to inventory the relevant City infrastructure that may be a 
candidate for Smart technology adaptation (smaller transistors, faster processors, more 
economically responsible sensors). This would allow for better precision when collecting and 
reporting real -time data which is used to inform day to day t ransportation -related operations, 
performance , and system trends.  Conduct Vision Element #3: Intelligent, Sensor -Based Infrastructure  
 
Conduct Vision Element #4: Urban Analytics  
 
 10 
  
 
Element #11 will aid in identification of reasonable telecommunications platforms, software, 
storage, and visualization systems that may transfer voluminous data sets furthering the 
unde rstanding of the area’s characteristics.  Identification would contribute to:  
 Developing one common operating platform  
 Informing the system user  
 Informing transportation staff  
 Ultimately, informing city government decision -making  
 
 
 
 
 
Element #4 process  has 6 (six) outcomes:  
1) Complex urban challenges, such as personal safety and mobility, network efficiency, 
environmental sustainability, will be identified. This may possibly provide a measure to 
assess the transportation network performance.  
2) Strategies t o resolve those challenges would lead to all -mode system user solutions.  
3) City staff would further benefit from what was static data, generally limited in scalability 
to auto -to-auto, transit -to-transit, bike -to-bike, ped -to-ped, decision making, to now see  
each mode more deeply analyzed, inter -mode comparability, relational analysis of each 
mode as it impacts the system, and how all these are additionally impacted/or impact 
the four data set areas previously mentioned –  
 
4) The newly collected data would all ow city operators to visualize how the operation of 
facilities, systems, services, and information generated for the public may be enhanced.  
5) These four aforementioned activities may create a continuous smart, connected, 
complete loop of data which will ult imately need to be identified.  Conduct Vision Element #4: Urban Analytics – Second Phase accounting for the identified  
SMART technologies and ICTs in order to understand the potential benefits of deployed 
solutions against the system infrastructure from Element #3  Conduct Vision Element #11: Low -Cost, Efficient, Secure, and Resilient ICT  
 11 
 6) Once the system infrastructure, smart technologies, and big data sets are identified and 
normalized, a continuous loop of information will be established.  
 
The development of the co ntinual loop process then allow the  four mo re system specific, road -
user interface, physical construction, application oriented Vision Elements to be blended with a 
specific focus on the Ultra Smart Corridor implementation :

A speaker series  was developed to allow citizens and decision makers to attend a wide array of 
presentations that influence what transportation looks like and how it will influence the City 
over the next 20 years.  Initiated t o address a host of digital, technological, and modal shifts in 
the industry , the first presentation was from the Arizona State University Technology Center 
Skysong and focused on transportation, commercial land use and urban commuter modal 
choice .  This Smart City proposal was addressed at the December 2015 City Transportation

 Best in cla ss Paratransit Programs for Senior Citizens  
The following discussion includes t he City’s transportation programs for Senior Citizens (65+), 
introduce the Greater Phoenix Age -Friendly Network, and explain the c ommunity’s involv ement 
in Age Frie ndly programs .  The City provides an interconnected network of transportation 
services for senior citizens (and disabled individuals) with three programs: 1) East Valley Dial -a-
Ride; 2) Cab Connection; and 3) Scottsdale Trolley.  In addition, all seniors are eligible f or 
reduced -fare on Valley Metro bus routes and light rail.  Every Scottsdale senior, whether or not 
they are disabled, is eligible for all three of these programs.   
East Valley Dial -a-Ride Service   
Provision of paratransit service to individuals living wi thin ¾ mile of any fixed route transit 
service is a Federal requirement.  The majority of jurisdictions nationwide provide Dial -a-Ride 
service to comply with the Federal law.  By 1995, several East Valley Cities either did not 
provide paratransit service, or found it extremely expensive to do so.  In 1999 the East Valley 
Dial-a-Ride program was started as a partnership with the City of Scottsdale and the cities of 
Tempe, Mesa, Gilbert and Chandler to comply with the Federal requirement.  The program 
today p rovides door -to-door paratransit service, during the same days and hours as a regular 
fixed route bus service.  Participants can qualify to use paratransit service through a Valley 
Metro certification process (called “ADA” Trips); or, if they are age 65 or  older certain cities 
within the program will provide “non -ADA” Trips without requiring a certification process ( the 
City of Scottsdale provides both “ADA” and “non -ADA” trips).  The non -ADA service is not 
federally required.  
 
All trips are scheduled thro ugh a call center.  Various types of vehicles, other than taxis, are 
used to fit each participant’s need.  In the beginning of Fiscal Year 2012 -13 the service delivery 
method changed from a collector/distributor system using large vehicles, to a taxi -based  
smaller vehicle system.  Under the old system large vehicles picked -up multiple participants and 
delivered them to their destination all along a single route (routes were designed daily by the 
stops scheduled).  This system kept participants on bouncy veh icles for a long time, sometimes 
for up to an hour and a half.  By scheduling a taxi trip for one or two individuals, the trip time 
for riders was shortened and the vehicles used were much more comfortable.  The majorit y of 
taxi trips are now taken with  more fuel efficient electric hybrid vehicles (like the Toyota Prius), 
while larger lift equipped vehicles are also used when needed. In line with the City’s growing 
population, and the nation’s aging population trend, the number of Dial -a-Ride trips steadily  
increased over the years until the recent recession when the number of trips declined.  
Three years later as the recession ended, a more convenient and comfortable taxi based system 
was implemented; ridership and program costs began to grow again. The rid ership trend 
(number of annual trips provided) is shown in Figure 1 below.  The use of more fuel efficient 
vehicles has resulted in contract cost savings, even though fewer individuals are transported 17 
 per trip.  The dra matic cost savings to the City  betwee n Fiscal Years 2012 -13 and 2013 -14 can 
be seen in Figure 2 below both in terms of cost per trip type, as well as total cost.

Cab Connection Taxi Voucher Program   
The City ’s taxi servi ce program for seniors started in the late 1950’s as an informal program. In 
2001 the service became more formalized and was named Cab Con nection.   It now p rovides 
over 45,000 taxi rides per  year, primarily to senior residents.  Cab Connection has four 
subprograms:   
 
1. Regular vouchers :  a. For those 65+ or certified disabled. b. Each participant receives up to 16 
monthly vouchers (1 vouch er = 1 one -way trip). c. Each voucher pays for 80 percent of the trip 
cost, up to $10.00. d. Approximate miles traveled per voucher are 2.92. e. The average fare paid 
per participant per voucher is $3.51.  18 
 2. Dialysis vouchers : a. Each participant receives  26 dialysis vouchers per month in addition to 
16 regular vouchers. b. The voucher covers 100 percent of the trip cost and also pays a 15 
percent driver tip.  
3. Wheels to Meals vouchers : Each participant receives between 38 – 46 vouchers per month 
dependi ng on city business days.  
4. City Volunteer Worker vouchers : Senior or disabled volunteers enrolled in a qualified work 
skills program with the City receive vouchers for transport to volunteer stations as needed.  The 
most recently implemented program, Wh eels to Meals, was developed by Transportation and 
Human Services staff. The Wheels to Meals program provides free transport for low income 
seniors from their home to the Granite Reef Senior Center for a nutritious lunch each day.  This 
noon meal is the pr imary, and sometimes the only, daily meal for these seniors.   
Participants are qualified based on income by the Human Services staff, and receive vouchers 
for up to 5 round trips per week to the Senior Center. Wheels to Meals started as a pilot 
program in  2013 with 15 individuals and due to its success has now become a permanent 
program with 21 current participants.  As expected, just as our community’s population ages, 
the number of participants served in the Cab Connection program increases every year, a s does 
the program cost.  A study of voucher use in Fiscal Year 2008 -09 indicated that the majority of 
participants used an average of only 16 vouchers.  To curb costs the number of vouchers was 
decreased from 20 to 16 for all participants.   
Maricopa Coun ty Area Government Proposition 400 funding was used to fund trips provided for 
ADA certified individuals.  Currently, 50 percent of the program cost is covered by Proposition 
400 funding. While the current level of Proposition 400 ADA funding will remain a vailable, 
future program cost increases will need to be funded directly from the Transportation budget.  
The number of trips provided and the program costs are depicted in Figure 3 below.  The figure 
illustrates the i ncrease in participants served and vouc hers used.  The cost per trip compares 
well to the Eas t Valley Dial -a-Ride trip cost.   
Once the Dial -a-Ride non -ADA fare wa s increased to $4.00, the City  staff expected to see an 
exodus from East Valley Dial -a-Ride to the Cab Connection as the average far e for participants 
on Cab Connection was less than $3.00. Unfortunately that shift did not occur.  There are still 
non-ADA participants taking short trips (less than 5 miles) using the more expensive East Valley 
Dial-a-Ride program instead of using the Cit y’s less expensive Cab Connection vouchers.  A 
program goal this year is to bring the shorter trip non -ADA Dial -a-Ride users over to Cab 
Connection.

Scottsdale Trolley System   
Scottsdale’s trolley system is well known throughout the valley, and not just for using old -
fashioned Trolley replica vehicles.  Two of the three route s (Miller Road and Neighborhood) 
have higher average daily ridership than many of the Valley Metro fixed routes.  These two 
routes primarily serve neighborhoods in the southern portions of Scottsdale with the highest 
senior populations.   The routes pick up  seniors from near their homes and take them to local 
activity centers.  By serving at the neighborhood level, senior citizens have a shorter walk to a 
transit vehicle.  A third Downtown Route provides service primarily for tourists.  The route 
provides a tour of the C ity for visitors in a nostalgic vintage looking trolley replica vehicle, 
introducing them to key attractions such as the Districts, Scottsdale Fashion Square, and many 20 
 of the City’s public art sculptures.  Transfers are accommodated between al l three Trolley 
routes.  In addition, the three trolley routes provide access to all Valley Metro bus routes, the 
light rail system, and the city of Tempe Orbit system.  The annual ridership of the system over 
the last five years has increased as shown in Figure 5.  The increase in boardings shown in Fiscal 
Year 2011 -12 is the result of the addition of Valley Metro Route 76 to the City’s Trolley system 
(Miller Road Trolley).  Upon the changeover to a farefree system, the route ridership doubled 
per month an d continues to rise every year.  Miller Road Trolley provides access throughout to 
a large number of senior housing units along Miller Road.  The System’s annual cost is sh own in 
Figure 6 .  The slight increase estimated in Fiscal Year 2014 -15 is the result  of the new contract 
rate that went into effect October 1, 2014.

Figure 6 . Scottsdale Trolley System Annual Budget Fiscal Years 2009 -10 to Estimated 2014 -15   
 21 
 Figure 7  below compares the average cost per boarding to Valley Metro’s average cost p er 
boarding per year.  The City ’s system cost is lower despite the fact that the system is not 
dependent on collecting a fare.  The City ’s annual system cost fluctuates slightly ea ch year 
depending on the number of days service is provided each month. The most important benefits 
for seniors is the fact that the service is provided free (no fare), and every vehicle is equipped 
with a wheelchair boarding ramp or lift.  Thirteen of the  21 vehicles have a low floor (loads at 
almost curb height) and a ramp making boarding for seniors as easy as walking on.  By 2016, all 
vehicles will be low -floor with a curb -height loading ramp.

Greater Phoenix Age -Friendly Network  
 
The City ’s Age Friendly Group ’s role in the age friendly program linked to the city of Phoenix 
program and is through our own Age Friendly Planning Committee.  The City ’s program is 
attended by approximately 15 community individuals who have an interest in transportation, 
shared housing and home modifications, health advocacy and care transitions, time banks, and 
villages.  In February 2014, a survey was taken b y participants in programs of Duet, the Senior 
Expo, and Cab Connection program. There were 1,257 survey respondents total. In several 
questions relating to maintaining lifestyle, transportation was a high ranking response, 
compared to other responses such  as health, nutrition, finance, etc.  In one particular question: 
“What do you most value about your community and/or most value to assist you to live 
independently?”   Over 60 percent of the 1,157 respondents that answered the question 
indicated Transporta tion was the most valued community asset (see the Report’s Figure 11 
next ).       22 
 
 
Best in C lass Traffic Volume and Collision Rate Data Report  vii 
The above report has been published for even numbered years since 1988, it is a collaborative 
effort with the Traffic Engineering Department and contains traffic volume and collision data 
for 324 street  segments and 203 street intersections.   Traffic Engineering conducts a top 20 
analysis of approximately 20 intersections that experience a high collision rate, ana lyze collision 
trends and conducts f ield visits at these locations. Mitigation measures are then recommended. 
These may include signing and striping changes t o capital improvement projects.   
Data collected for the Collision Manual comes from the collision  database maintained by Traffic 
Engineering.  Traffic volume data is collected by Traffic Engineering technicians over the two -
year period with two counters placed at each intersection approach.  Data is seasonally 
adjusted based on historical data.   Volum es reported in the manual consist of the sum of all 
approaches to an intersection.   The following is example information  extracted from the recent 
report;   
 The Collision Manual is broken into segm ent data and intersection data   23 
  Segment data are divided int o collision data and volume data. Segment collision rates 
and volume data are sorted by location and descending criteria as we ll as historical 
comparisons   
 New to the 2014 manual, volume to ca pacity ratios are also included   
 Intersection collision rate and  volume data is sorted by intersection locat ion with 
historical comparison  
 The collision rate is defined as the collision experien ce related to traffic exposure  
 For segments, it is defined as collisions per million vehicle miles traveled, calculated 
using the annual number of collisions on the segment, the daily traffic volume and the 
segment length.  The city -wide average segment collision rate in 2014 was 1.35 
collisions per million vehicle miles traveled, representing an increase from  the 2012 
average ra te of 1.31  
 Intersection collision rates are defined as collisions per million vehicles entering the 
intersection. The 2014 average City -wide collision rate is 0.57 collisions per million 
vehicles entering the intersection, representi ng an increase for 2014  of 0.52   
 For segments, the highest collision rate of 9.59 and a total of seven collisions was 
experienced on Camelback Road between Hayden  Road  and Granite Reef  Road .  
Camelback Road between Scottsdale  Road  and Miller Road had a total collision rate of 
7.69 and 31 collisions, due to a higher vo lume of traffic in this segment   
 When sorted by highest frequency, the segment collision experience, Frank Lloyd Wright 
between Greenway Hayden and Hayden Road had the greatest number of collisions at 
53.  Shea Boule vard between Scottsda le Road and Hayden Road had 37  
 For 2014 volume to capacity ratios, the highest ratio of 1.28 is experienced on Shea 
Boulevard between Loop 101 and 90th Street, followed by Chaparral Road between 
Miller  Road  and 78t h Street, with a rati o of 1.22  
 For intersection data, the highest collision rate experienced is 1.66 at the Loop 101 and 
Frank Lloyd Wright interchange, followed by the Hayden  Road  and Thomas  Road  
intersection, with a rate of 1.61, the Loop 101 and Raintree  Road  interchange at  1.56 
and the two Scotts dale Road intersections at 1.45   
 When intersections are sorted by highest frequency of collisions, the highest rate is 
experienced at the Loop 101 and Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd interchange at 51 collisions.  
 The Collision Manual is use ful in analyzing city -wide trends, based on metrics such as 
population, daily vehicle miles traveled, city -wide number of collisions, time of day, 
month of collision, manner of col lision and violation by driver.  24 
  Between 2006 and 2012, there was a sharp dec rease in collision rate, however this 
trend is reversing somewhat since 2014, with an increase  in the rate.   
 Annual vehicle miles traveled show an increase from 1994 through 2006 with this rate 
stable since that time. The number of collisions sharply fell after 200 6, but has increased 
since 2012.  
2016  General Plan Working Draft   
See also General Plan link http://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/Asset62223.aspx  
 
The General Plan is the primary tool  for guiding the future of the C ity.  It contains the 
community’s goals and policies on character and design, land use, open space and the natural 
environment, business and economics, community services, neighborhood vitality, 
transportation, and growth.  It shapes the  physical form of the C ity, yet it also addresses other 
aspects, such as human services, protection of desert and mountain lands, arts and culture, 
community health, and the character of neighborhoods.  The General Plan provides a guide for 
day-to-day, as well as short - and long -term decision -making.  The City’s General Plan  has three 
interrelated roles: i t is an expression of community vision, a spirations, values, and goals; i t is a 
decision -making guide; and i t fulfills State and City Charter legal requir ements.  
The goals and policies in the General Plan are implemented through ordinances, regulations, 
ongoing procedures, recommendations from City boards and commissions, and decisions made 
by the City Council.    
 
                                                            2016 General Plan Working Draft 20135 Vision viii 
General Plan draft Chapter 5ix – Connectiv ity is where the largest discussion of transportation 
reside s, although you will find the i mportance of trans portation throughout the other seven 25 
 chapters.  The chapter defines the City’s transportation system as the backbone of the C ity, 
supporting the economy and serving and influencing land use patterns.  The automobile 
historically has been, and will continue to be, the predominant mode of transpo rtation in the 
City of Scottsdale.  However, to match the character, needs, and lif estyle of different areas, the 
City will need to diversify its transportation choices.  A variety of mobility choices will provide 
greater accessibility and connectivity; al leviate pollution and congestion; and foster community 
well-being and quality of life . 
It recognizes the primary role of the automobile, but also fully integrates other modes, such as 
public transit, air travel, bicycling, and walking.  The plan also recog nizes the interrelationships 
among transportation , land use, neighborhoods, and growth and activity a reas.  Different areas 
within the C ity may have unique mobility needs requiring specific -area solutions.  However, 
transportation systems and their impacts  do not sto p at the C ity’s boundary.  Therefore, this 
element stresses the efficient use of Scottsdale’s existing transportation systems and strong 
inter -jurisdictional coordination.   
When it comes to mobility  the City strives for cost -effec tive, diverse, affordable, adaptable, and 
innovative local and regional mobility option s that serve all its  residents, commuters and 
visitors.   The City ’s Shared Vision is a path into the next century.  It do es not presume to ‘know’ 
the future.  Rather it sets forth the clear magnetism of our special char acter and purpose.     
2016 Transportation Master Plan Update   
See also Transportation Master Plan link http://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/Asset62223.aspx  
 
History  
The c urrent Transportation Master Plan is a 400 -page, 11 -chapter document that was 
unanimously adopted by the City Council on 8 January 2008.  The implementation plan was 
adopted by the City Council on 13 January 2009.  This was the first comprehensive 
Transpor tation Master Plan for Scottsdale.  T he Scottsdale City Council appointed a General 
Plan Task Force that  began meeting in January 2013.  The Transportation Department 
monitore d the General Plan development.  I n spring of 2014, the City Council elected to d elay 
the General Plan vote until 2016.  The General Plan Task Force continued their efforts and 
completed their recommended draft in November 2014.  The recommended General Plan is  
being presented to the Scottsdale Boards and Commissions and the general pu blic throughout 
2016.   
 
The citywide voter election is currently  anticipated for November 2016.  T he Transportation 
Department resume d revision of the Transportation Master Plan utilizing the current d raft 
General Plan as its basis.  Three of the most inn ovative aspects of the 2008 Tra nsportation 
Master Plan are;  26 
  The adoption of “Complete Streets” as the basis of planning, design, and construction of 
all streets in  the City  
 The investigation of three different types of High Capacity Transit on Scottsdale R oad 
from Chaparral Ro ad to the City of Tempe  
 The reduction of the planned right -of-way and street width f or 32 separate street 
segments  
The 2016  Transportation Master Pl an Characteristics and Process  
The process to develop the new Transportation Master Pla n began in April 2015 at a regularly 
scheduled Transportation Commission meeting.   The intention was to provide generalized 
system guidance ra ther than meticulous specifics.  Also, to provide separate public hearings at 
designated Transportation Commissio n meetings to present each of the following four sections: 
Streets, Transit, Bicycle, and Pedestrian.  The Bicyc le and Pedestrian Elements were also 
discussed at regular or designated Paths & Trails Subcommittee meetings.     
 
Purpose  
The Transportation Mas ter Plan is tentatively scheduled for a recommendation by the 
Transportation Commission to the City Council on 4 February  2016.  This document is similar to 
the General Plan.  It is not intended to list specific projects.  Specific project lists are the 
function of the City Council annually adopted Capital Improvement Plan.  An exception to this 
intent is multi -use path and trail priorities. Pages 34 through 52 indicate in both maps and 
tables; h igh, medium, and low for multi -use path and trail priorities.  The multiuse path projects 
are primarily those included in the 2008 Transportation Master Plan, as supplemented with 
additional projects identified in the past year of deliberations.  The trails priorities are those 
determined by 2004 Scottsdale Trails Ma ster Plan and the 2009 Ad Hoc Citizens Trails Task 
Force.  These multi -use path and trail priorities are provided as numerous improvements and 
connections are necessary to complete our multi -use and trail system.  
 
League of American Bicyclists (LAB) Bike F riendly America Program  
Background  
The League of American Bicyclists (LAB) offers the Bicycle Friendly America program for 
communities, states, universities, and businesses as a tool to make bicycling available for 
transportation and recreation.  The Bicyc le Friendly Community Program (BFC) provides 
incentives, hands -on assistance and award recognition for communities that actively support 
bicycling.  These communities welcome cyclists by providing safe accommodations for cycling 
and encouraging people to b ike.  Increasing the safety and comfort of bicycling improves a 
community’s public health, environment, quality of life, and contributes to economic 
development.  The City was awarded Silver level in 2005 and was notably the first community 
without a uni versity or college to reach this level in the  national program.  Scottsdale was 27 
 awarded Silver again in 2007.  In 2011, Scottsdale was awarded Gold, which was a goal of the 
2008 Transportation Master Plan.   
 
Transportation staff provided an update to the Pa th &  Trails Subcommittee on 7 July  2015 and 
the Transpo rtation Commission on 16 July  2015.  Discussion included the recent public 
meetings, feedback, and portions of the application.  Staff finalized and submitted the Bicycle 
Friendly Communities applicati on on 11 August 2015.  The League of American Bicyclists 
announced the results of the Bicycle Friendly Communities applications on 16 November  2015.  
Scottsdale’s Gold designation was renewed for the next four years.    
Bicycle Signal Detection Technology Implementation  
Background  
Bicyclists that use on the on -road bike lane system in the City of Scottsdale currently rely on 
vehicles or signal phasing to actuate a green light to cross signalized intersections.  Bicycle 
detection only exists at t hree interse ctions in the City .  Bicycle detection is used at signalized 
intersections to alert the signal system of bicycle crossing demand at a particular approach.  It is 
much like the existing vehicle detection syst ems at many City intersections.  The goal of this  
program is to implement a consistent reliable technology that will accurately detect bicycles 
and provide clear guidance to bicyclists on how to actuate detection.  In April 2013, staff began 
investigating bicycle detection technologies availability  and v isited local jurisdictions using 
various technologies.  In July 2013, staff gave a presentation to the Transportation Commission 
on various bicycle signal detection technologies such as manual push buttons and automated 
devices (e.g., inductive loops, vide o cameras, infrared, microwave, and magnetometers).  
Through research and discussions with other jurisdictions, staff found that inductive loops and 
video cameras are the most widely used automated bicycle detection technologies due to their 
versatility an d reliability.   
 
Recommended Technology  
Based on the  research, video camera detection is the best technology to use in the city of 
Scottsdale.  Staff proposed  a pilot project to install bicycle video detection at two intersections. 
If the pilot project is  successful, other intersections will be added to the system.

 Sustainable Transportation Implementation  
The City has been partnering with ADOT’s Sustainabl e Transportation Program for the last two 
years.  As one of two cities in Arizona to begin adopting a comprehensive sustainable 
transportation approach to planning, design, construction, maintenance, and operatio ns via 
participation in ADOT’s local public agency outreach program, the City is scheduled to issue its 
first annual sustainable transportation annual report in th e fall of 2016.  The City appeared as 
part of ADOT’s first ever annual report in 2015.x A greenhouse gas emissions C ity framework is 
envi sioned, is a natural extension for the City to the December 2015 U.S. Mayors Report on a 
Decade of Global CIimate Leadership ,xi and would be accelerated under a this opportunity.  
Resilience  
The major wash, Indian Bend Wash, runs  north to south through the h eart of the City.  L ow 
water crossing s are also prevalent throughout many of the northern sections of road.  The City 
has spent extensive resources addressing extreme weather and how it affects the traveling 
public.   The City’s emergency, operations, and m aintenance have a mature process for handling 
storm damage and any smart infrastructure implementation  would be additionally assessed for 
weather risk.    
Conclusion  
Scottsdale, Arizona respectfully request s to be seriously considered for the Smart City 
demonstration funding.  The City is motivated and capable of handling such an opportunity and 
hope s the package submitted reflects the requirements to meet this challenge.  Please contact 
The Mayor’s Office or the Director of Transportation , Paul Basha , with  any que stions.  
Partnering  beyond all participating City individuals  
Arizona Department of Transportation  (see support letter from this partner)  
Arizona is a great state for testing transportation technologies.  In addition to the strong 
support from Arizo na Department of Transportation (ADOT) and  our Governor’s office, climates 
that range from the extreme hot desert to the extreme cold with snow, ice, etc. We have large 
metropolitan areas and rural roadways, including freeways (hea vy truck usage), transit,  etc.  
The Arizona Department of Transportation, Maricopa County Department of Transportation, 
and the University of Arizona have developed the Arizona Connected Vehicle Test Bed in 
Anthem, Arizona to support the development and testing of advanced traffic  management 
strategies based on vehicle -to-infrastructure communications.  This Test Bed includes 11 fully 
equipped intersection s that operate 24 -7 with our Multi -Modal Intelligent Traffic Signal System 
(MMITSS) and have plans to expand to the I -17 freeway  segment.  The applications comprised 
of intelligent traffic signal control, priority signal control for emergency vehicles, transit buses, 
and freight trucks, ramp metering control, and a pedestrian application to enable access to 
pedestrians.  The infras tructure based systems use SAE DSRC standards for communicating with 29 
 vehicles and include additional vehicle -to-vehicle capabilities such as issuing roadside alerts for 
first responders and work zones and emergency vehicle alerts for emergency vehicles.  
Furthermore, Arizona Department of Transportation, Maricopa County Department of 
Transportation, City of Scottsdale, Arizona Department of Public Safety, Scottsdale Police 
Department/Fire Department, and Salt River Pima -Maricopa Indian Community develop ed 
freeway -arterial Integrated Corridor Man agement system (ICM) on L -101, which is the first ICM 
in the state and planning to advance to ful ly aut omated system in the future as well expanding 
the concept fu rther to other routes in the region.  
 
Maricopa County Department of Transportation  (see suppor t letter from  this partner)  
The Arizona Connected Vehicle Team (MCDOT, ADOT and University of Arizona) has a deep and 
hands -on understanding of connected vehicle systems and architectures, including the CVRIA, 
SAE DS RC standards (J2735 Messages, J2945 Performance Requirements), as well as existing 
traffic operations including development and deployment of advanced connected vehicle 
enabled transportation management systems (adaptive control, transit priority, freeway,  
arterial), transit systems, emergency management (ALERT, REACT), and Stakeholder 
engagement.   The team has deployed Connected Vehicle technology in Anthem, Arizona on 
Daisy Mountain Drive complemented by a USDOT Multi -model Intelligent Traffic Signal Syst em 
(MMITSS) and has demonstrated the proven systems engineering methodology for successful 
design, deployment, and testing along the ‘live’ corridor.   Maricopa County is one of the most 
advanced county transportation departments in the country.

4	Jacksonville	"Beyond Traffic: The Smart City Challenge 
Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonvi lle 
 
Fg4ID Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonville 
 As the largest geographic city in the United States , admittedly, there are a few places in the City 
of Jacksonville where parking is not a problem. Of course, those places are very often adjacent 
to pasture land for livestock rather than in downto wn. Nonetheless, as the 12th largest city in 
United States by population, at over 820,000 people , we have plenty of parking issues, traffic 
issues, public transit issues, and general quality of life issues. While we have a growing and 
robust public transportation network with a steady increase in ridership, Jacksonville has 
historically been a very auto-centric city. As such , we have a high number of vehicles in our 
roads daily, hence a higher traffic volume. 
The local electorate has time and again demanded th e tax rate within the City remain among 
the lowest in the State of Florida. While this allo ws for a business-friendly climate, it makes 
providing essential services to nearly a million pe ople more challenging, especially following the 
recent recession. Florida was one of the states hit  hardest by foreclosures, a fact that had an 
even greater impact on local governments. The money  necessary for capital improvements has 
shrunk. Maintaining the necessary cash flow to cove r debt service remains a challenge. 
Necessary repairs go undone. This past spring, duri ng our Mayoral election, a section of 
roadway along the St. John’s River in downtown fell  in upon itself, leaving nearby residents 
without power for days. 
Finally, two of our unfortunate claims to fame invo lve fatalities. Last year, Jacksonville had over 
100 homicides for the second year in a row. Additio nally, we were ranked the third highest 
Pedestrian Danger Index (PDI) of large metro areas in the country in 2014. PDI is the rate of 
pedestrian deaths relative to the number of people who walk to work in the region. It is simply 
not safe on our streets. 
We are well capable of handing the current traffic load on our roads. However, we do have rush 
hour back-ups, slowdowns, and standstills due to th e 100,000 people who come into the City 
each day from surrounding counties, and the nearly 60,000 people per day who commute into 
downtown. But for how long will we be able to effec tively handle this ever increasing load? As 
is the case in most major cities, one stalled vehic le can substantially increase commute times. 
Pair this with expected population increases to cit ies, especially Southern cities, and the 
realities of the L.A. freeway seem ever looming. 
The strengths of our City are like pencil lines on a blank canvas outlining the masterpiece that is 
prepared to unfold. Jacksonville sits at the inters ection of the eastern and southern corridors of 
the federal interstate system with the crossing of Interstates 10 and 95, but does not have any 
other abutting metro areas. JAXPORT, our deep water  port, handled 8.3 million pounds of cargo 
in 2014. Jacksonville International Airport has 90 non-stop daily flights with a 15 percent lower Fg4II Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonville 
 ticket price than comparably sized airports, and Ce cil Spaceport is an operational, registered 
spaceport. Additionally, Jacksonville has two Class  1 rail lines (CSX and Norfolk Southern) giving 
our port rail connectivity to the entire southern a nd eastern corridors. 
The consolidation of our city and county government s means our Mayor and City Council 
govern 75 percent of the urban population, and we h ave established interlocal agreements with 
the transportation authority, electric and water ut ility, port authority, and airport authority. 
Our Mayor holds appointment power for a varying num ber of appointees of each authority. 
This consolidated form of government has made coope ration with entities such as our 
Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) much smoot her. Our local MPO, the North Florida 
Transportation Planning Organization (TPO) represen ts four counties covering more than 3,000 
square miles and 1.3 million citizens, as well as t he United States Navy, which has two bases 
and nearly 25,000 enlisted personnel within the MPO . 
The success of the collaboration between the TPO an d local government is evidenced by the 
completion of a $11 million, state-of-the-art Regio nal Transportation Management Center 
(RTMC). The RTMC has 6,500 square foot of traffic m anagement space and 32 individual work 
stations, which can all view the 24’ x 6’9” video w all. This facility is capable of withstanding a 
Category 3 hurricane, and is the first facility in Florida to be interconnected to the Florida 
Department of Law Enforcement to facilitate a combi ned response to Homeland Security 
threats. 
The implementation plan for the Connect to Jax (C2J AX) project is simple and straight forward. 
First, we will complete our ITS foundation, includi ng replacing dated fiber optic cable in our 
urban core, complete unconnected runs of fiber opti c lines, install nearly 1,000 additional 
Bluetooth traffic sensors, complete installation of  GPS trackers in all public vehicles including 
police, fire and emergency vehicles, as well as, al l public works vehicles, and any unconnected 
public transit vehicles, and develop agreements wit h and promote the use of mobile apps, such 
as Waze, which will incorporate the data collected.  Completion of these current assets will give 
us connected capability across our 840 square mile footprint that serves 75 percent of our 
urban population, with the ability to easily expand  to cover the additional 25 percent in our 
region. 
Next, we will focus on expanding our ITS foundation  through the installation of wireless 
internet at each of our 1,000 intersections, expand ing our preemptive signaling plan for 
emergency and public transit vehicles, expanding ou r network of 48 smart sensor enabled 
street lights to the entire urban core, and complet e our current plan for our Bus Rapid Transit 
(BRT) system to appeal to more commuters and reside nts without vehicles. After the 
completion of the first two aspects of the C2JAX pl an, Jacksonville will have an impressive ITS Fg4I( Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonville 
 foundation on which to build. For a cost of approxi mately $10-12 million dollars, our 
infrastructure will have the capability to: 
• Measure point of origin and destination information  on 532 miles of freeways and 
arterial roadways through a system of over 700 mile s of fiber optic cable and 1,000 
Bluetooth traffic sensors combined with public vehi cle GPS and mobile app integration; 
• Connect first responders, public employees in the f ield, connected vehicles, and private 
citizens through a network of over 1,000 connected intersections, enabling our system 
to 
o increase the capabilities of first responders and p ublic employees by providing 
continuous wireless connectivity to a high speed ne twork, 
o provide the ability for preemptive signaling across  the system for first 
responders and public transit, 
o allow for real-time route changes to adjust to vari ances in traffic volume and 
flow in the entire system, and 
o connect to coming future technologies such as conne cted and automated 
vehicles, public and private drones, and others; 
• Manage traffic flow and implement cross agency, coo rdinated responses from a single 
location through our state-of-the-art Traffic Manag ement Center; 
• Provide valuable information to the public that is both useful to everyday citizens 
through mobile app integration, as well as to the p rivate sector in machine readable 
formats, at a minimum. 
Finally, with a solid ITS foundation, we will expan d our capability for future technologies, such 
as automated vehicles, expand our data collection a nd use to increase efficiencies to improve 
environmental impacts and user-focused services, an d develop long-range planning that 
anticipates the future demands of citizens while in corporating smart land use principles. We 
will implement these strategies in a wheel and hub approach consistent with the foundational 
infrastructure we have solidified. 
While maintaining downtown as the hub for the entir e City and enhancing its vibrancy, we can 
focus on specific neighborhoods to enhance their vi tality through smart technology. For 
instance, installing smart light fixtures with mobi le app connectivity that serve to increase 
public safety and increase parking turnover in key business districts can have a substantial 
impact on pedestrian safety and the economic vitali ty of the, mostly, small businesses in these 
areas. Additionally, we can reduce the necessity fo r cars in local neighborhoods and increase 
the availability of bike share and car share option s to reduce the growing strain on parking. 
Implementation of the C2JAX plan will continue to b e a joint effort between the City of 
Jacksonville, Jacksonville Transportation Authority , North Florida Transportation Planning Fg4I) Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonville 
 Organization, and Florida Department of Transportat ion, District 2. Cooperation and 
collaboration is currently the business model betwe en each of these partners and this will 
continue to be the case. 
Due to the cooperation and collective foresight of all past partners, Jacksonville is poised to be 
a world leader in smart and connected technologies.  We have made sound, common-sense 
decisions that have made our City a better place to  live. Our project fits the timeline and scope 
of this challenge, and when complete, will create a  complete ITS infrastructure that meets the 
needs of a million people, is ready to accept conne cted and automated vehicles, goes beyond 
traffic solutions to determine the utility of other  technologies, provides open, machine-
readable data, and fosters an innovative and entrep reneurial environment. 
POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS 
 
Jacksonville is a rapidly growing metropolitan city  in Northeast Florida and one of the state’s 
major urban population centers. With 127.6 square m iles of water, Jacksonville’s ability to 
accommodate leisure activities, water transportatio n and military institutions was inevitable. In 
1940, Naval Air Station Jacksonville was built as a  major training station in World War II. In 
1942, Naval Station Mayport was built and continues  to operate today. These military 
installations, along with other nearby facilities, make Jacksonville the third largest military 
presence in the country behind Norfolk and San Dieg o. Jacksonville is a key location for national 
defense and international commerce. 
Jacksonville is currently a major logistics distrib ution center and intermodal transportation hub 
on the eastern seaboard of the United States. The c ity has a transportation network embracing 
port and air cargo facilities, rail, and trucking r outes that allows millions of tons of raw materials  
and manufactured goods to move through the City ann ually. The Jacksonville Port Authority 
reported over 2,000 vessels with 915,292 TEU’s used  the port in FY 2015. Over 180,000 
passengers have embarked on cruises from JAXPORT in  each of the last four years. 
According to the 2010 Decennial Census, Jacksonvill e has a population of 821,784 people. The 
city has a land area of 747 square miles and a popu lation density of 1,100.1 persons per square 
mile compared to the State of Florida’s average pop ulation density of 350.6 persons per square 
mile. The City of Jacksonville represents a signifi cant portion of the population of the 2010 
Census Urbanized Area that it is located in. The ci ty represents 77 percent of the urbanized 
area’s population. The City of Jacksonville and Duv al County are a consolidated form of 
government. The four other incorporated entities wi thin Duval County (Jacksonville Beach, 
Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach, and Baldwin) have no t been included in the demographic and 
geographical characteristics for the City of Jackso nville. Fg4I4 Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonville 
 Jacksonville is the largest city by area in the con tinental United States. The distance between its 
most extreme eastern point and its western edge is approximately 40 miles. Within the City of 
Jacksonville, there are nearly 500 distinct neighbo rhoods, ranging from rural to suburban to 
dense urban core areas. Fifty-nine percent of the C ity’s population is Caucasian, while 
approximately 31 percent of the population African- American. Jacksonville also has a sizable 
Hispanic population, which constitutes 7.7 percent of the population. 
The Census Urbanized Area has a population of 1,065 ,219. Many people who work within the 
City of Jacksonville often commute from the urbaniz ed area’s communities surrounding 
Jacksonville and Duval County. Growth presents the Census Urbanized Area with challenges and 
opportunities. Projections from the University of F lorida show that developed areas will 
approximately double between the 2010 and 2060 Cens uses, and a population increase will 
follow suit.  
Nearly 75 percent of this area’s population today i s Caucasian. Approximately 22 percent of the 
population is African-American, and there is a risi ng Hispanic population at approximately 6 
percent. Statewide, approximately 68 percent of the  population is White, 15 percent Black and 
17 percent Hispanic. Regionally, Hispanics and Lati nos are projected to have the largest 
increase in numbers when compared to their current population. By 2030, the Hispanic and 
Latino populations are projected to increase by app roximately 100,000 people. This represents 
7 percent of the projected 2030 population for the area. 
Finally, although Jacksonville is the largest geogr aphic city in the United States, our urbanized 
area does not connect to any other. For purposes of  testing system-wide technology, we are a 
stand-alone, self-supporting system, which will mak e data more reliable and increase our ability 
to determine the root causes of problems and the ef fectiveness of our solutions. 
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM 
The Jacksonville Transportation Authority (JTA) is an independent state agency governed by a 
seven-member Board of Directors. JTA operates Jacks onville’s public bus service, downtown 
automated Skyway and paratransit service. The Autho rity also plans, designs and builds roads 
and bridges. JTA’s mission is to improve Northeast Florida’s economy, environment and quality 
of life by providing safe, reliable and efficient m ultimodal transportation services and facilities. 
In 2015, JTA set out Blueprint 2020 outlining the h ighest priority projects to be implemented 
over the next five years. Key Blueprint 2020 Smart City Initiatives include: 
Skyway System Plan and Technology Assessment 
Downtown Jacksonville’s Automated Skyway Express, c ommonly known as the “Skyway,” is a 
2.5 mile bi-directional system with eight stations.  Planning started in the 1970s, and the first Fg4(M Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonville 
 segment became operational in 1988. The total cost of the Skyway implementation was 
approximately $186 million (including planning, des ign, construction, vehicles and equipment) 
using local, state, and federal funding. With strat egically based stations, the Skyway could 
expand through the downtown core and serve both sid es of the river. With infrastructure 
improvements, a fully built out automated system co uld operate both on an elevated system 
with at-grade extensions into nearby neighborhoods.   
Bus Rapid Transit 
In addition to the Skyway, JTA has developed the $1 23.3 million First Coast Flyer Bus Rapid 
Transit (BRT) system consisting of 84 stations and 57.7 route miles connecting to downtown 
along some of Jacksonville’s busiest corridors. Two  of the five corridors opened to commuters 
in December 2015. The remaining will roll out over the next three years. Over the course of the 
rollout, transit signal priority will be added to 9 6 intersections and two new Park and Ride lots 
will open. 
Route Optimization Initiative 
With its Route Optimization Initiative, JTA recentl y focused on capturing the transit dependent 
population that was not taking advantage of the pub lic system. JTA has shifted its focus to 
these communities that have a natural transit rider ship by optimizing transit routes to make 
them frequent and more direct. Through technology d irectly aligned with GPS radio 
communications systems on board buses, customers ca n access real-time passenger 
information on their smart phones and computers. In  its initial year, ROI has had a 6 percent in 
ridership growth, with 12 percent and 18 percent in crease during Saturdays and Sundays, 
respectively. As a result of ROI and his work in up grading Jacksonville mass transit, JTA CEO 
Nathaniel Ford was among 11 officials from across t he country to receive the “White House 
Transportation Champion of Change” award in October  2015.  
Jacksonville Regional Transportation Center 
JTA’s vision of a regional multimodal hub is coming  to a reality with the Jacksonville Regional 
Transportation Center (JRTC). The JRTC will be a mu ltimodal hub, located in the heart of 
downtown that will integrate key local, regional an d intercity service in one location. The key 
benefit of the JRTC will be improved connectivity b etween modes including local bus, BRT and 
Skyway; regional bus and future commuter rail servi ce; and intercity bus and passenger rail 
service. Design on the JRTC began in December 2015.  Construction of the intercity bus terminal 
will begin in 2016 with JRTC construction set to st art in January 2017. 
ENVIRONMENT AND CAPACITY 
A 12-year partnership among the North Florida Trans portation Planning Organization (TPO), 
Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) and Flo rida Highway Patrol (FHP) culminated in Fg4(’ Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonville 
 November 2015 with the opening of the North Florida  Regional Transportation Management 
Center (RTMC) in downtown Jacksonville. As the corn erstone of the North Florida Regional ITS 
Master Plan, the RTMC was funded by the TPO as part  of their ongoing investment in Intelligent 
Transportation Systems, which totals over $30 milli on since 2003.  
In addition to the TPO, FDOT, and FHP, the RTMC als o houses transportation pods for officials 
from the City of Jacksonville, the Jacksonville Fir e and Rescue Department, the Jacksonville 
Sheriff’s Office and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. FHP provides 
dispatch for ten state law enforcement agencies fro m the Center, while FDOT District Two is 
connected to every other District RTMC in Florida. A future goal is to bring in operators and 
data analysts from additional agencies, such as JTA . 
This state-of-the art center is the hub of the regi on's Intelligent Transportation Systems 
infrastructure encompassing traffic signal controll ers, vehicle detection sensors, travel origin 
and destination sensors, wind sensors, cameras and message signs. As the first Transportation 
Management Center in Florida to co-locate staff acr oss agencies, the RTMC is the ideal facility 
to support Smart City strategies.  
The City of Jacksonville and its partners have demo nstrated through past grant awards their 
ability to receive and administer large-scale award s. The City has sufficient staff to fully and 
expeditiously carry out the demonstration throughou t the period of performance. City partners 
such as FDOT and JTA have a long history of complet ing large transportation projects on time 
and on schedule. 
JTA manages up to $40 million per year in grant fun ds, both in capital and operations.  As a 
designated recipient of Federal Transit Administrat ion funds, JTA is familiar with the process of 
applying for and securing grant funds, procuring go ods within grant fund parameters, meeting 
federal DBE standards, and overall administration o f federal grants.  
The City of Jacksonville and its partners have part icipated in several demonstration and pilot 
projects focused around Smart City technologies. In  2010, JTA and the City were one of the 
early adopters in testing AVL devices programmed sp ecifically for Transit Signal Priority along a 
highly travelled corridor connecting downtown Jacks onville to the City of Atlantic Beach. 
Another partner, FDOT District Two, has installed a  system to provide parking availability 
information to truckers as they approach a rest are a just south of Jacksonville. This project 
installed two high definition microwave vehicle det ectors (MVDs), a CCTV and a dynamic sign. 
The MVDs are used to count the number of vehicles e ntering and leaving the truck parking area 
and the CCTV is used by RTMC Operators to verify vi sually what the MVDs are telling them. 
Computer software was written that adds vehicles en tering the truck parking area and then 
subtracts them when they leave the truck parking ar ea, thus constantly updating the number of Fg4(R Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonville 
 available spaces. The number of spaces is then sent  to the dynamic display sign so that truckers 
know the number of available spaces at the rest are a. This project used existing ITS 
infrastructure (fiber optic cable and device cabine ts), which was key in minimizing the cost of 
installation.  
Most recently, the City partnered with General Elec tric and the JEA, Jacksonville’s Electric 
Authority, to launch an Intelligent Lighting pilot program with 48 lights fixtures and sensors 
installed along two downtown streets. While the ini tial rollout is focused on lighting controls 
and parking enforcement, the system has the ability  to detect gun shots, improve pedestrian 
safety, identify available parking, and monitor tra ffic flow, illegal activities, storm water, air 
quality, and garbage collection, as well as provide  public Wi-Fi and electric car charging stations. 
SHARING ECONOMY  
As part of Jacksonville’s commitment to the sharing  economy, plans for the Jacksonville 
Regional Transportation Center include both car sha re and bike share by 2019. A city-wide bike 
share system would also tie into the City of Jackso nville Bicycle Master Plan set to be complete 
by the end of 2016. 
In another Blueprint 2020 initiative, JTA and 12 re gional partners developed TransPortal , a 
Virtual Transportation Resource Center accessible o nline or by phone. It provides a single point 
of access to plan and book regional and local multi modal travel including: 
• Traditional transit & paratransit  
• Bicycling 
• Walking 
• Car and van pools • Volunteer driver programs 
• Social & not-for-profit agency 
services 
 
This information includes cost, travel time and ava ilability. The transportation resource center 
also provides customers with the ability to reserve , modify or cancel paratransit trips through 
the Internet. 
TransPortal won the Innovator of the Year Award fro m the Florida Commission for the 
Transportation Disadvantaged in August 2013 and the  Trapeze Group Innovate Award in 2014. 
ACCESSIBLE DATA  
With the TransPortal program, JTA and its partners share data to help the citizens of Northeast 
Florida find the best transportation options for th eir unique trip. The development of this 
regional system has been the result of the coordina ted and dedicated efforts of the regional 
partners who have the vision to look outside of the ir individual agencies and focus on the needs 
of customers. Fg4(L Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonville 
 Transportation partners in the region have long rec ognized the value in multi-loading 
passengers from different counties going to similar  destinations. However, it was difficult to 
coordinate these trips manually. By sharing softwar e and machine readable databases, the 
coordination of trips through TransPortal is automa ted. The software enables JTA and other 
agencies to optimize trips while maintaining the se cure separation of client and trip 
information. 
TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS 
The C2JAX demonstration deployment aims to use a sy nergistic array of technology 
applications. In combination these applications wil l test the technologies, identify traveler 
behaviors, measure performance and ultimately achie ve the potential of connected vehicles 
(CV) and automated vehicles (AV) in a busy downtown . 
Jacksonville’s demonstration technology solutions w ill realize multiple synergistic effects. Each 
of the technology uses listed below aim to bring to gether complementary CV and AV 
applications. For example, intelligent traffic sign als and pedestrian sensors on light fixtures 
conjoin for safety benefits. These synergies aim to  capitalize on inherently complementary 
capabilities, and so reduce costs and increase bene fits for drivers and businesses affected by 
delay and safety considerations. 
As shown in the annotated map, the C2JAX demonstrat ion will use the following technology 
solutions aligned with the twelve USDOT vision elem ents. 
Completing the Network 
Additional fiber 
Connecting intersections throughout Jacksonville to  central signal management software at the 
RTMC is imperative for an effective traffic managem ent system. The ability to make remote 
and/or real-time timing adjustments, monitor system  health and quickly detect and track both 
critical and minor system malfunctions is critical to an efficient transportation system. 
Furthermore, properly creating network rings by ins talling redundant communication routes 
increases reliability.  
For this reason, completing the City’s fiber optic network is the first priority in order to 
implement C2JAX technology solutions. FDOT has inst alled 145 miles of fiber connecting ITS 
devices along the interstate system in North Florid a. JEA, Jacksonville’s Electric Authority, also 
has thousands of miles of fiber that could be used to connect Smart City sensors. However, on 
some arterial roads and in certain areas of downtow n, Jacksonville still has gaps in the network. 
The missing pieces can be seen on the site map. Fg4IDFg4IP Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonville 
 Google has begun working with city leaders to explo re the possibility of bringing fiber to 
Jacksonville which would definitely be incorporated  into the C2JAX demonstration. Full network 
connectivity will create over 1,000 communications hubs at each signalized intersection 
providing city residents and visitors with free pub lic gigabit Wi-Fi, access to communications, 
information and municipal services across the city.  To realize the potential of connected 
vehicles, Jacksonville’s network must first connect  to intelligent infrastructure.  
Intelligent Traffic Signal System  
Currently, 473 of Jacksonville’s 1,040 intersection s are connected to the City’s network with 
advanced traffic controllers. As part of the C2JAX demonstration, the remaining 567 
unconnected signals would be upgraded in tandem wit h the rollout of additional fiber. Once the 
network is complete, Jacksonville will have a techn ologically advanced signal system that is real 
time responsive across the entire City for easy int egration with the other C2JAX solutions. In 
addition, Emergency Vehicle Preemption and Transit Signal Priority functionality will be added 
along heavily travelled corridors as controllers ar e connected and upgraded. 
BlueTOAD devices 
The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), in  partnership with the North Florida TPO 
deployed BlueTOAD traffic monitoring devices along major roadways throughout North Florida 
in 2013. This technology allows transportation plan ners and incident management to monitor 
and provide archived data for performance monitorin g and real-time data for operations. 
Bluetooth Travel-time Origination and Destination ( BlueTOAD) detects anonymous message 
authentication code (MAC) addresses, wireless ident ifications used to connect Bluetooth™ 
technologies on mobile devices in vehicles such as phones, headsets and music players. The 
system calculates travel time through analysis of s ubsequent detections.  
Device installations are non-intrusive and are typi cally completed in under an hour. Travel times 
and road speeds are available in real time. Integra tion with existing traffic information systems, 
including overhead signs, web portals and traffic m anagement centers, is straightforward. All 
data is archived for robust analysis of speed trend s, origin-destination, route patterns, trip 
length analysis and signal timing studies.  
The City of Jacksonville and FDOT currently maintai n 160 BlueTOAD devices. An additional 918 
devices would be needed to complete the system on a ll interstates and arterial roadways 
providing valuable data to the analysts at the RTMC . 
Other sensors 
Other ITS sensors that are currently used by the Ci ty and other agencies are 100 dynamic 
message signs, 30 road weather information systems and over 200 CCTV cameras. While these 
stand-alone sensors and communication devices will continue to be deployed on freeways and Fg4IDFg4ID Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonville 
 arterials, the demonstration will add this smart in frastructure to light fixtures as part of an 
expansion of the smart lighting downtown pilot proj ect. Video on Demand, air quality 
monitoring, storm water/street flooding monitoring and public Wi-Fi can also be added to these 
Intelligent light fixtures allowing for flexible up grades based on future ITS needs.  
Completing the gaps in Jacksonville’s current infra structure development will allow for 
interconnected communication between travelers and all the partner agencies based at the 
RTMC and satellite locations. These local agencies can then utilize all the data generated by 
these sensors to target areas of need due to demand  and growth. Freight operations at 
JAXPORT can be enhanced to reduce delay, decrease e nvironmental impacts, improve 
schedules and decrease bottleneck areas. Looking to  the future, the region can easily 
implement the next steps needed to address connecte d and automated vehicle technology.

C2JAX App Development 
Mobile computing, social media, GPS and data analyt ics offer new ways to more efficiently 
move people around Jacksonville. Information techno logy is being recognized as the key that 
allows people to use roads and transit services mos t effectively. Real-time information should 
clearly describe what routes are optimal based on a  citizen’s mode choice. The key to this 
transformative technology is the real-time link bet ween transportation and transit partners and 
individual drivers and passengers conveniently util izing these services. 
Currently, there are multiple transportation apps f ocused on Jacksonville. Through the C2JAX 
demonstration, we will determine the best way to ma ke the system’s data readily available to 
users. Ideally, this will be accomplished by partne ring with developers of a private app, such as 
Waze, discussed below. However, if that option prov es to not be possible, the partners possess 
the capability of developing our own app so interna l development is a possibility. This app will 
aggregate Jacksonville’s transportation and transit  information from multiple sources. With the 
additional fiber and sensors completing Jacksonvill e’s ITS network, this app would expand 
FDOT’s 511 information to include data from the art erial system as well. With sensors on 
intelligent light fixtures and in parking garages, the app will have the ability to send turn-by-turn 
directions to the nearest available parking space u ltimately allowing reservation of parking and 
payment by smart phone.  Fg4IDFg4II Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonville 
 With a robust, open-source app creating incentives to new and established transportation 
businesses, Jacksonville can leverage the data feed ing C2JAX to place traffic information in the 
pocket of travelers while at the same time optimizi ng travel performance based on user 
feedback. 
The following transportation apps focused on Jackso nville will be integrated into C2JAX: 
FDOT’s 511  
The FDOT 511 Traveler Information System is a free phone and internet resource that provides 
real-time traffic information on Florida limited ac cess facilities. The statewide system provides 
information on commuter travel times, construction,  lane closures, crashes, congestion and 
severe weather affecting traffic. Callers can also access a limited amount of public transit, 
airport and seaport information. In the event of an  emergency, 511 provides information on 
road closures and evacuation information. Selected area CCTV camera feeds are also available. 
Traditionally, this service has focused on the free ways, but is beginning to expand to the 
arterials. 
Waze 
Waze is a relatively new, free community-based traf fic and navigation application recently 
purchased by Google. The application, while in its early developmental phases, is capable of 
providing travel time, speed and incident informati on for a user’s potential route. The 
information is based on “Wazers” who actively feed the program data and confirm incident 
conditions, educating other users on traffic condit ions in real time. FDOT has recently begun to 
partner with Waze to see how it can be used to prov ide this information for the state’s arterial 
network. 
Transit Apps 
JTA’s innovative TransPortal database has received multiple awards for helping citizens navigate 
the full spectrum of regional transportation option s. JTA real-time transit information can found 
at NextBus, but in order to process payments for el ectronic tickets customers must navigate to 
a separate app such as My JTA or JTA’s STAR Card we bsite and app.  
For travelers regularly crossing the St. Johns Rive r east of downtown, the City of Jacksonville 
Information Technology Division developed an app wi th real-time ferry departure updates.

Automatic Vehicle Location Optimization 
Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) is already being u sed to track over 400 vehicles in the FDOT 
fleet and on JTA BRT buses. Expanding Jacksonville’ s AVL capability will allow the City to track 
and manage its vehicles resulting in better perform ance and lower overall fleet costs. Adding 
AVL to the remainder of the JTA bus fleet and parat ransit vehicles will assist in the Route 
Optimization Initiative and is a necessary componen t of Transit Signal Priority across all routes. 
A live, interactive view allows fleet managers and traffic analysts at the RTMC to observe fleets 
of vehicles across agencies. Managers can monitor t ransit, public works, emergency response 
or utility vehicles in real time, noting vehicle st atus easily, seamlessly, and directly within the 
RTMC or satellite location. Using a combination of technology, hardware and software, AVL is a 
Smart City technology solution to control costs and  manage resources through real-time, 
accurate monitoring of every vehicle in the City’s fleet.  
Emergency Vehicle Preemption  
Emergency Vehicle Preemption (EVP) for emergency fi rst responder vehicles is a connected 
vehicle technology solution that would be leveraged  with AVL installation on City police cars 
and fire trucks. The goal of EVP is to facilitate s afe and efficient movement through 
intersections. EVP can improve response times, redu ce intersection crash rates and prevent 
injuries and related costs. 
Transit Signal Priority 
JTA’s newly instituted First Coast Flyer BRT routes  offer efficiency gains in moving more people 
in fewer vehicles along heavily travelled routes. T ransit Signal Priority (TSP) reduces dwell time 
at traffic signals for BRT vehicles by holding gree n lights longer or shortening red lights. On 
other JTA bus routes, though, service suffers from poor signal progression due to heavy 
volumes and passenger vehicles blocking access to b us stops.  
With AVL installed on the entire JTA fleet, TSP cou ld be added to all connected signals reducing 
trip times and increasing reliability of all routes . The performance of this application would be 
measured by capturing real-time data to estimate bu s travel time savings and person-hours 
saved.

Intelligent Light Fixtures 
Intelligent lighting presents a unique platform for  demonstration technologies. Lights are a 
ubiquitous presence and provide an optimal location  for cameras and ITS sensors. Additionally, 
light fixtures already provide a source of power, s ecure mounting and a commanding viewpoint 
of surrounding areas. Light fixtures equipped with ITS sensors can serve as a foundation for a 
safer, more efficient and intelligent city. Leverag ing the technologies currently being used in the 
GE intelligent lighting pilot program, the demonstr ation would add future Smart City 
capabilities outlined below. 
Pedestrian Safety 
Pedestrian safety can be improved by generating ear ly warning signals for drivers. These early 
warning signals will be sent from a fixture that ha s detected a pedestrian in the street to 
vehicles that will soon be crossing the area. With data on these pedestrian movements 
collected from the fixture sensors, the RTMC will o ptimize traffic signal times for road users.  
Using advanced video analytics, the fixture sensors  can monitor and detect pedestrians crossing 
the road and immediately send notifications to near by vehicles (including early adopter transit 
and emergency vehicles), intelligent traffic signal  infrastructure and personal mobile devices. In 
the case of an incident, relevant information can b e recorded in the form of images, video 
streams and audio. This information can be made ava ilable to relevant authorities for further 
analysis, ultimately incorporating lessons learned into improved pedestrian safety.  
Initial deployment of these sensors will be focused  on accident data particularly focused on bus 
stops, senior citizen centers and school zones. Tra ffic safety enforcement will be targeted to 
these high-risk areas, further increasing pedestria n safety for vulnerable senior citizens and 
small children. 
Intelligent Parking 
Light fixtures equipped with intelligent sensors ca n be used to reduce traffic and increase 
turnover in key business areas of the city of Jacks onville by using existing parking spots more 
efficiently. An estimated 30 percent of traffic in a city is caused by drivers searching for parking 
spots. Intelligent parking solutions will help the City of Jacksonville reduce congestion, improve 
air quality, and create more turnover during busine ss hours, benefiting area business owners 
and retail establishments. Another benefit of this solution is the optimization of parking 
enforcement efforts. Using advanced video analytics , City staff can identify parking violations 
and available parking spaces. 
Notification of potential violations detected by in telligent fixtures can be sent to the authorities 
for immediate action. GPS-time stamped photos of th e vehicle in violation will aid them in Fg4IDFg4I4 Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonville 
 proving culpability. This solution can also help dr ivers to better understand their parking 
options, including on-street parking availability. 
In anticipation of future electric vehicle deployme nt, the intelligent fixtures can also serve as 
energy storage and charging stations for parked EVs . JEA, a key partner in installing intelligent 
lighting, is exploring the use of smart-grid techno logy in the fixtures as part of the North Florida 
Clean Fuels Coalition’s long-term strategy for prom oting EVs. 
Dynamic Wayfinding  
Another use of intelligent lighting that will be in corporated into the project is the opportunity 
to add dynamic messaging signs to the fixtures and use the lights themselves as a way to direct 
drivers, cyclists, pedestrians and first responders  to optimal routes. 
For special events, lanes can be reversed to accomm odate traffic flow by changing messages on 
digital signs attached to each fixture through a se cure communication environment from the 
RTMC. During certain times of day or days of the we ek, streets open only to cyclists and 
pedestrians can be easily identified by these signs . 
Additionally, popular bicycle/pedestrian routes tha t share lanes with cars can have higher light 
levels. In the event of a traffic accident, emergen cy personnel could bring a dimmed light up to 
full, just in the area of the accident. In other ca ses, police, fire rescue or medical personnel 
could reach their destination faster if the pole-mo unted LED fixture in front of a home or 
business was flashing continuously as a beacon.

Open Data Portal 
With new ITS sensors implemented at connected inter sections and installed as part of the 
rollout of Jacksonville’s intelligent lighting pilo t, the RTMC will amass volumes of data. 
Additional data will stream in from citizens intera cting with the C2JAX app. Sharing this data 
among the demonstration partners will help break do wn agency boundaries and organizational 
silos, allowing for more efficient service delivery . In addition to shared intra-agency information 
collection and dissemination, a fundamental goal of  this project is to make this flood of data 
easily accessible to the public. 
 Fg4IDFg4(M Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonville 
 Open, machine-readable data will be made available to everyone allowing entrepreneurs to dig 
deeper with their own analytic tools that will supp ort emerging transportation businesses. New 
value will be created when third parties develop in novative applications and services to address 
public and private needs. Open data will also empow er citizens increasing engagement with 
transportation agencies and encouraging participati on in policymaking and planning for the 
future. 
This open data will be integrated and organized by the City’s Information Technology Division 
and will be made available from the City of Jackson ville website. It will be rolled out at an early 
stage of the demonstration and scaled up as citizen s increase their usage.

Skyway Extension and Automated Vehicles 
JTA’s Automated Skyway Express (Skyway) is the driv erless downtown people mover that 
currently travels a 2.5 mile bi-directional system with eight stations from 6am-9pm on 
weekdays. Ridership is relatively low, averaging 4, 930 a day in 2015, but for special events like 
the 2005 Super Bowl and the annual One Spark festiv al ridership can climb to over 80,000.  
Due to out-of-date technology (current Skyway vehic les are beyond mid-life and past due for 
overhaul), JTA has launched a Skyway Modernization Program including replacement of the 
existing vehicles and evaluation of future extensio ns. As JTA explores the proper vehicles, it 
could be the setting for the next generation of aut omated technology that could utilize the 
elevated structure and explore at-grade extensions as technology allows.  
As the C2JAX downtown smart sensors are added to tr affic signals and intelligent light fixtures, 
an automated vehicle picking up passengers from the  current Skyway terminals can utilize the 
connected vehicle technology to move commuters into  outlying neighborhoods without the 
high cost of fixed elevated rail and station constr iction. Connecting these neighborhoods to the 
urban core would ultimately spur transit oriented d evelopment and smart land use. 
As a pilot project, an electric assist bike share f leet would provide data on potential routes 
where automated personal transit vehicles would eve ntually be deployed. A system plan 
identifying the optimal downtown circulator system that connects with existing and emerging 
downtown developments and nearby neighborhoods is c urrently being developed by JTA. Fg4IDFg4(’ Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonville

RISKS 
Every effort will be made to minimize technical, po licy and institutional risks throughout the 
course of the C2JAX technology deployment. 
The key technical risks are associated with hardwar e and software. While highly unlikely, bugs 
in the implementation of the sensors and operation of applications may result in vehicle 
crashes. Traffic flow may be impeded if the applica tions that enhance signal coordination and 
traffic progression fail. We will address these ris ks by designing the system to be as fail-safe and 
fault tolerant as possible. Software and devices wi ll be beta tested downtown on weekends 
when traffic is lowest, next during off-peak period s and finally during peak period when results 
can be expected to be safe. 
Political risks are likely to be minimal as the cur rent mayoral administration strongly supports 
the project. The next election in 2019 is outside t he timeframe of the grant. The Strong Mayor 
form of consolidated government allows for easier i mplementation of demonstration projects 
than other systems of local government.  
Institutional risks among partner agencies will be mitigated with interlocal agreements outlining 
specific roles and responsibilities. Turnover of ke y agency personnel is mitigated by a 
redundancy of capable staff at the City and partner s at the RTMC. 
PARTNERS 
City of Jacksonville, Florida 
The applicant organization is the City of Jacksonvi lle, Florida. The City of Jacksonville and Duval

In addition to developing these plans and programs,  the North Florida TPO identifies issues, 
convenes stakeholders, conducts studies and develop s policies in light of local, national and 
global trends. The TPO also addresses current needs  and challenges that impact our daily lives 
through programs for commuters, the transportation disadvantaged, bicyclists and pedestrians. 
The North Florida TPO also hosts the North Florida Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) 
Coalition. The ITS Coalition has over 100 members, representing 60 agencies and organizations 
from throughout Northeast Florida that are stakehol ders in the deployment of intelligent 
transportation assets. The coalition created an ITS  Master Plan for the region in 2007 and an 
update to the Master Plan in 2010. The plan lays ou t a Regional Architecture for ITS deployment 
across multiple boundaries and jurisdictions. The I mplementation Plan component describes 
the process for planning and implementing ITS proje cts throughout the area. 
The TPO Board is comprised of elected officials and  transportation agency representatives. 
Under board direction, the TPO is led by an Executi ve Director with professional staff in 
transportation planning, modeling, communications a nd finance. The Mayor of Jacksonville and 
three City Council members sit on the board. The Se cretary of FDOT District 2 is a non-voting 
advisor to the board. Fg4IIFg4ID Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonville 
 JEA, Jacksonville’s Electric Authority 
JEA is the City of Jacksonville’s public utility pr ovider. JEA owns and operates an electric system 
with five generating plants, and all transmission a nd distribution facilities, including over 745 
miles of transmission lines and more than 6,500 mil es of distribution lines. JEA is also a joint 
owner with Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) of a  sixth power plant, the St. Johns River 
Power Park (SJRPP), which is operated by JEA. The u tility receive 9.6 megawatts of methane-
generated power from Trail Ridge Landfill and 12.6- megawatts of energy from a 100-acre solar 
project on the Westside of Jacksonville that contai ns 200,000 solar panels. In 2013, JEA 
generated 12.5 million megawatt hours of energy. 
A public-private partnership that JEA recently beca me a part of is GE’s Intelligent Cities 
program. The program involves JEA trialing a new GE  LED solution, which uses LED street 
lighting installations to connect, collect and anal yze data being generated, harnessing the 
power of the “Internet of Everything” to assist the ir city and utility to run better while providing 
new services and conveniences for residents and vis itors. Street lights will be repurposed with 
LEDs containing sensors, controls, wireless transmi tters and microprocessors. This will allow JEA 
and the city to be able to create new opportunities  for reducing cost, optimizing their 
operations and creating value-added services for it s customers. In addition to piloting the 
intelligent-city enabling solution, JEA will also p ilot LightGrid™, a wireless controls technology, 
which will provide significant energy savings to th e city. LightGridTM allows for more efficient 
management of streetlights. With remote monitoring and GPS mapping, municipalities are able 
to instantly identify usage and performance of stre et lights within specific locations. 
JEA's governing body is made up of a Board of Direc tors appointed by the Mayor and confirmed 
by the City Council. The Board of Directors then ap points a CEO, who selects a top tier of 
management referred to as the Senior Leadership Tea m. 
Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce 
The JAX Chamber is the chamber of commerce for Jack sonville and the surrounding area. It is a 
not-for-profit organization with more than 3,000 me mbers serving Northeast Florida. The JAX 
Chamber promotes economic development by attracting  and retaining companies, creating 
jobs and fostering a skilled workforce. Through adv ocacy programs, the Chamber works for 
business and represents business interests at the l ocal, state and federal level. Another 
program, the Buy Chamber initiative promotes local member-to-member purchasing.  
The JAX Chamber has a Transportation and Logistics Council that specifically serves the 
transportation and logistics industry. The committe e works to foster an environment where 
transportation, logistics, supply chain professiona ls and policy makers, as well as those who 
serve those businesses, can meet, educate, debate a nd discuss cross-industry solutions. Fg4IIFg4II Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonville 
 Jacksonville Port Authority 
The Jacksonville Port Authority (JAXPORT) is an ind ependent agency responsible for the 
development of public seaport facilities in Jackson ville. It owns three cargo facilities and a 
cruise terminal, and, according to a recent study, generates 132,000 jobs and more than $27 
billion in annual economic impact for the northeast  Florida region. 
JAXPORT is committed to the ongoing enhancement of port infrastructure and facilities. 
Construction was recently completed on a new interm odal container transfer facility at Dames 
Point, which facilitates the direct transfer of con tainers between vessels and trains. The new 
facility will allow for two unit trains each day (o ne inbound and one outbound) carrying up to 
200 containers each. Other capital improvements are  currently under construction – made 
possible with over $100 million in federal and stat e funds. This project will enable future 
connections to sensors embedded in these infrastruc ture upgrades. 
Downtown Investment Authority 
The Downtown Investment Authority was created to re vitalize downtown Jacksonville by 
utilizing Community Redevelopment Area (CRA) resour ces and the Downtown Development 
Trust Fund to spur economic development. The Downto wn Investment Authority (DIA) is a 
governing body for the Community Redevelopment Area  (CRA) established by the City of 
Jacksonville. DIA and the City offer a variety of i ncentives for business to locate downtown, 
including expedited permitting and economic develop ment incentives. 
DIA’s investments are steered by a six-member Board  of Directors who conducts open-to-the-
public business on an unpaid, volunteer basis. All six are confirmed by the Jacksonville City 
Council. It was formed to revitalize and preserve d owntown property values and prevent 
deterioration in the downtown business district. Th e day-to-day operations of the DIA are 
administered by a Chief Executive Officer and four additional full-time staff. 
EXISTING TRANSPORATATION INFRASTRUCTURE 
There are 387 arterial miles and 145 freeway miles within the City of Jacksonville. 
Transit Services 
In 2013, users of all forms of public transit servi ces logged 12,677,900 unlinked passenger trips 
in Jacksonville. Public transit customers travelled  79,384,700 passenger miles in the same year, 
ranking Jacksonville 44th in public transit mileage. 
The Jacksonville Transportation Authority is the ma jor public transit service provider for 
Jacksonville. JTA has a fleet of 220 transport vehi cles and currently runs 44 scheduled bus 
routes, including two bus rapid transit (BRT) syste m lines and a road-based trolley line.  Fg4IIFg4I( Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonville 
 JTA recently began operating its bus rapid transit (BRT) system and branded it the First Coast 
Flyer. The BRT system is made up of five distinct p rojects: the Downtown project, which will 
connect the four corridors of the North, Southeast,  East and Southwest. When completed, it 
will be the largest BRT system in the Southeast cov ering a distance of 57 miles. During FY2014, 
the Downtown and North corridors of First Coast Fly er entered the final design phase and plans 
were advanced to bring the Southeast, East and Sout hwest corridors to fruition. Service began 
on the Downtown and North corridors in December 201 5, while the total $134.1 million system 
is scheduled for completion by the end of 2016, pen ding funding.  
The JTA Skyway continues to be an arm of the downto wn transit network, with a 2.5 mile 
elevated monorail. Skyway users logged 1,079,200 un linked trips in 2013 and 495,100 
passenger miles. One of only five people movers in the United States, the Skyway celebrated its 
25th anniversary on June 3, 2014. In December 2015,  the JTA’s Board of Directors approved 
Resolution No. 2015-30, related to the future of Sk yway. The Resolution call for JTA to 
implement a Capital Plan to replace the vehicles, u pgrade the operating system and 
infrastructure considering innovative technologies available. The Resolution also addresses for 
a Financial Plan that will identify the needs for m odernization, and potential system expansion. 
JTA also runs a Stadium Shuttle Service (SSS) that transports football fans from JTA lots located 
around Jacksonville to Jacksonville Jaguars NFL gam es. SSS operates three hours before kickoff 
and one hour after each game. 
In furtherance of the Americans with Disabilities A ct, JTA offers a Paratransit Service to provide 
destination to destination public transportation fo r people with disabilities who are unable to 
use fixed route services. Paratransit Service also offers travel training to ADA paratransit eligible 
individuals who have the ability to use fixed route . 
Shared-use Mobility Services 
A variety of shared-use mobility services are offer ed in Jacksonville. These include a multitude 
of traditional vehicle-for-hire resources, includin g: taxi, limousine and airport shuttle services. 
Technology-enabled shared-use services are also ava ilable such as the ride-sourcing services 
Lyft and Uber; the round-trip carsharing service Zi pcar; and the Peer-to-Peer carsharing service 
Relay Rides. The North Florida TPO also manages the  “Cool to Pool” commuter matching and 
tracking carpool system. 
Information and Communications Technology (ICT) 
FDOT has deployed over 145 miles of ITS fiber commu nication and ITS devices along the 
Interstate system in North Florida (approximately 6 8 miles on I-95, 15 miles on I-10 and 62 
miles on I-295). It is currently or will be deployi ng another 260 miles of fiber along the I-75, I-10 Fg4IIFg4I) Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonville 
 and I-95 corridors thereby allowing this region abl e to tie into motorists over 100 miles away 
from the North Florida region. 
Within the City of Jacksonville, there are nearly 2 00 miles of fiber communication and over 500 
technologically advanced signal systems that are re al time responsive. Combined, the abutting 
counties of Nassau, St. Johns and Clay County will be interconnected to provide another 100 
miles of fiber communication and technologically ad vance signal systems. JEA has thousands of 
miles of dark fiber that could be leveraged to incr ease fiber connectivity and bandwidth. 
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) 
Several major arterial corridors are instrumented I TS assets, including upgraded traffic 
controllers, CCTV cameras, network hardware and sof tware and advanced traffic management 
systems. The North Florida TPO has funded ITS deplo yments on over 100 miles of arterial 
roadway. ITS technology deployments include FDOT fi ber optic backbone networks, nearly 150 
CCTV cameras, 100 Dynamic Message signs, 160 Blueto oth sensors, hundreds of advanced 
traffic signal controllers, over 30 road weather in formation systems and nearly 400 vehicle 
detection systems. 
The North Florida Regional Transportation Managemen t Center (RTMC) recently opened in 
Jacksonville in November 2015. The RTMC houses mult iple agencies, including Florida 
Department of Transportation Operations, Florida Hi ghway Patrol Dispatch, Jacksonville 
Sheriff’s Office Dispatch, Jacksonville Fire and Re scue Department, City of Jacksonville Traffic 
Engineering Division, North Florida TPO and other S tate and regional agencies. FDOT’s District 
Two RTMC is connected to every other FDOT RTMC in F lorida. In the operations center, RTMC 
staff employees can monitor feeds from the 600 came ras scattered throughout the city, many 
of them on interstates throughout the area. The cam eras do not record any information, but 
can be used to provide multiple angles of an accide nt to help first responders on scene. 
The RTMC is responsible for providing information o n accidents and incidents to the traveling 
public, so that they can make informed decisions on  their travel routes. Accidents and incidents 
occur on a daily basis, which close lanes or cause congestion along Interstates and arterial 
roadways. One way in which the RTMC can gather info rmation is through a BlueTOAD system 
that uses the cell phone Bluetooth of travelers on ITS deployed roads to ping paired sensors, 
which record travel time between them. In areas whe re it is difficult or not cost effective to 
install other types of vehicle detection, Bluetooth  devices are an easy, efficient means of 
generating travel times. That travel time is transl ated into a color-coded map. When vehicles 
travel between sensors at the speed they should be,  the route is green. If a vehicle is traveling 
too slowly or is at a standstill, the yellow and re d coloring shows the duty officers that there is a 
situation on that part of the road. In addition to travel times, the devices are able to provide 
Origin/Destination data for planners and result in greatly reduced costs for O&D Studies. To Fg4IIFg4I4 Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonville 
 date, the BlueTOAD devices have been found to be re liable and easy to maintain. By 2020, 
every interstate in Florida should have cameras, ve hicle detection and a fiber optic backbone 
installed. 
FDOT District 2 is working with the South West Rese arch Institute (SWRI) and FDOT central 
office to create a new section of the statewide Sun Guide software which would allow RTMC 
operators to dynamically change signal timing or di vert traffic depending upon the type of 
incident. Once the SunGuide update is complete, tra ffic on I-95 can be diverted to US-1 and 
RTMC operators can monitor congestion, post detour messages and change signal timing to 
better control traffic flow on US-1. Similarly an i ncident on US-1 could result in detouring traffic 
to I-95 to avoid excess congestion on US-1. 
Smart Grid Infrastructure 
The North Florida Clean Fuels Coalition (NFCFC) is currently funding a regional Electric Vehicle 
network. The North Florida TPO has budgeted $300,00 0 to purchase and install approximately 
25-30 electric vehicle charging stations. These sta tions will support the region’s current 267 
registered EVs and more rapid purchase of vehicles.  Currently the growth rate of EV 
registrations in the region is over 50 percent a ye ar.  
The North Florida TPO, through the North Florida Cl ean Fuels Coalition, is developing a 
partnership with JEA to help design, build, operate  and maintain the station network. Stations 
will be located based upon stakeholder input using a siting analysis. The NFCFC is also assisting 
JEA with its long-term strategy for promoting EVs, which involve incentives for purchase of EVs 
and, potentially, new rate structures. Together wit h other NFCFC stakeholders, the network will 
be branded and marketed throughout Northeast Florid a, potentially complemented by 
roadway signage. As the project planning and implem entation proceeds, the North Florida TPO 
will work closely with regulatory agencies.  
DATA 
Most of the data collected by the City of Jacksonvi lle and its partners is currently focused on the 
estimation of travel time reliability. With the Blu eTOAD devices already in place, the RTMC can 
check travel time and speeds in comparison with pre dicted travel time reliability along freeways 
and a limited number of arterials. With the ultimat e goal of reducing vehicle travel delay, this 
point-to-point travel time information allows the R TMC partner agencies to judge performance 
and provide triggers for implementing alternative t iming and travel plans. 
With the additional fiber and sensors needed to com plete the network, the City’s partners at 
the RTMC will be able to see a real-time picture of  Jacksonville’s entire transportation system 
with the ability to remotely adjust signal timing a nd change routes with dynamic messaging 
signs at every connected intersection. With the inc rease of connected vehicle data, delays can Fg4IIFg4(M Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonville 
 be mitigated by using EVP and TSP to move emergency  and transit vehicles more safely and 
efficiently. Until CV devices become commonplace in  every vehicle, mobile apps or the C2JAX 
app will be able to provide a two-way exchange of i nformation including user comments, 
instructions from RTMC staff, travel time data and information collected from intelligent 
lighting fixtures. With advanced recognition techno logy, these new sensors will also aid in route 
optimization for pedestrians, cyclists and eventual ly automated vehicles. 
This new transportation data will be readily integr ated into JTA’s transit system resulting in 
more efficient trips, which in turn will attract us ers and revenue. Additionally the new sensors 
will allow for increased public safety surveillance  combating both accidents and crime, as well 
as ensuring fair policing. Information from a smart  parking management system will lead to 
optimized use of parking enforcement resources and sensors could eventually monitor debris 
on the road and trash bins triggering street sweepe rs and garbage trucks. Knowing the location 
of all city vehicles will allow agencies at the RTM C to more effectively control and route traffic. 
JEA, Jacksonville’s Electric Authority, has been at  the forefront of the collection and 
dissemination of Smart City data with about 130,000  intelligent two-way electricity meters 
installed, which accounts for about a third of thei r system. JEA uses their advanced meters for 
billing, remote connect/disconnect, and register, i nterval and demand data capture. Currently, 
JEA deploys SCADA controlled protective devices suc h as Automatic Reclosers and Automatic 
Switches that allow their Operations team to keep c ustomers in power and also restore power 
faster in various scenarios. JEA is also working on  retrieving voltage data from their AMI system 
to better leverage potential distribution efficienc y projects in the future, such as Conservation 
Voltage Reduction and Distributed Generation Suppor t. Another possibility is having the meter 
data potentially detect voltage issues on the syste m before causing an outage or a customer 
complaint. Finally, with the improvements in EV tec hnology, JEA is looking to gather data from 
this project to strategically place charging statio ns around its service territory. 
ARCHITECTURE AND STANDARDS 
All partner agencies currently conform to the ITS s tandards published by the FDOT Central 
Office ITS Department. As detailed in the North Flo rida ITS Master Plan, all agencies using 
federal and state funds are required to conform to these standards. 
To ensure conformity to the North Florida Regional ITS Architecture, all new partner projects 
are submitted to the North Florida ITS Steering Com mittee using a project update form 
eventually being incorporated into formal ITS Archi tecture updates. All C2JAX projects will 
submitted for conformity review and lessons learned  will be shared with the 100+ members of 
the North Florida ITS Coalition.

CAPACITY 
The City of Jacksonville was ranked third nationwid e by the Center for Digital Government and 
Digital Communities Program. In its 14th annual Dig ital Cities Survey in 2014, the organization 
recognized Jacksonville as third best overall among  American cities with a population of 
250,000 or more. The Center for Digital Government ranked Jacksonville third overall again in 
2013 and tenth overall in 2012. 
The Center for Digital Government’s survey focused on how cities achieved their goals and 
objectives and increased efficiency despite tight f iscal constraints in the current economy. Top 
overall priorities include transparency, open data,  mobile applications and competent IT 
personnel. 
As mentioned earlier in the application, the partne rs have decades of collective experience 
managing large, federally funded projects. In 2011,  the USDOT awarded JAXPORT a $10 million Fg4IIFg4(R Connect to Jax – C2JAX: A smarter, better Jacksonville 
 grant toward the development of an Intermodal Conta iner Transfer Facility. This facility opened 
on schedule in late 2015 and is now facilitating th e direct transfer of containers between 
vessels and trains, speeding up the shipment proces s and reducing the number of trucks on the 
road. 
COST LEVERAGING 
In 2014, Jacksonville City Council extended the 6-c ent Local Option Gas Tax (LOGT) to 2036. 
There is an interagency agreement between JTA and t he City to share this tax, 5 cents to go to 
JTA and 1 cent to go to the City for road, pedestri an and bicycle projects. The City has discretion 
to implement ITS infrastructure with its share of t he LOGT. Additionally, funds from 
Jacksonville’s Storm Water Fee can be used for capi tal improvements.  
JTA also has considerable discretion regarding $15 million of its share of the LOGT, $5 million of 
which has been allocated to mobility enhancements t hat could include adding intelligent 
lighting and sensors to Mobility Corridors. Mobilit y Corridor projects may include items such as 
sidewalks, bike paths, transit accessibility improv ements, lighting and bus shelters 
The North Florida TPO has provisional plans to depl oy ITS of three of the major arterial streets 
needed to complete Jacksonville’s network in the ne xt two years. The TPO was the primary 
funder of the RTMC as part of their ongoing investm ent in Intelligent Transportation Systems, 
which totals over $30 million since 2003. 
FDOT has provided matching funds for several federa lly funded projects in the Jacksonville 
area, including $20 million for the JAXPORT TIGER g rant. FDOT will continue to support 
technology solutions with the rollout of its progra mmed District Two ITS projects through FY18. 305

A Model for Innovative and Equitable Mobility
Beyond Traffic: The Smart City Challenge
A new New Orleans
A Model for Innovative and Equitable Mobility
New Orleans has always been at the forefront of change. 
From its French settlement to its Spanish concession, from 
its reconnection to the French Republic to its purchase 
into the Union, New Orleans has continually adapted and rein -
vented itself. Whether through the changing political landscape 
of its history or from forces of nature like Hurricane Katrina, we 
have demonstrated great resilience, rising to meet the challenges before us. A major port city, jobs center, and international tourist destination, our city blends a topography that traverses sea level 
with an urban tapestry of historic narrow streets weaving em
-
blematic buildings, music, cuisine and art. As we approach our 300th anniversary, signs of progress are everywhere. Population is 
growing, business is booming and universities are expanding. We are building a new airport, redeveloping our storied riverfront and creating a 21st century medical corridor. Levels of civic engage
-
ment are the highest ever. In parallel, a key challenge is to build the technical and data infrastructure that will enable new mobility 
services, modes, and applications. We want to pioneer new solu
-
tions for mobility that improve convenience, equity, congestion 
and quality of life. Our proposed projects are vital to accelerating 
our progress toward becoming a well-connected, data-driven city 
that is a model of sustainability – a Smart City.4
A new New OrleansOur Vision
Imagine this: a city where every job 
is accessible and every destination 
reachable. Imagine a city where the 
dignity of every individual is respected not just in terms of equal access but also in terms of the respect for an individual’s 
time. Imagine a city whose citizens move 
seamlessly across every conceivable mode of transportation. Imagine a city 
where free will and informed choice 
are made possible through technology. Imagine a city where delivery of goods is expertly and efficiently coordinated. This 
is what we imagine for New Orleans. 
We are a city that has reinvented itself over and 
over—sometimes by necessity, as in the wake 
of Katrina’s destruction a decade ago, or often 
through the tenacity of our community to want something better like the reform of our edu-
cation system. We have proven ourselves as a 
reliable partner, capable of achieving the impos -
sible. Now we have set our sights on demon-
strating to the country and ourselves a better 
and smarter vision for improving our communi-ty and our quality of life.
A Smart City meets its challenges of congestion, 
mobility, capacity, air quality and safety not sim-ply by building more, but by building smarter. 
We propose to build a powerful data gathering 
infrastructure that will enable a platform we call the Urban Operating System upon which we will 
build a host of new mobility services, modes, 
and applications.
This new infrastructure will serve our two cities 
simultaneously: a city of residents, 384,000 
strong, and a city of visitors occupying the 35,000 downtown hotel rooms and thousands 
of cruise ship cabins. Like two sides of the brain 
each must work in concert with the other. The residents focus on their daily commute, their 
social interactions and the needs of everyday 
living. Our visitors, ready to have fun, navigate through a city of which they may have little comprehension. For both, communication and 
access to information are critical. This symbiotic 
connection will be enriched by our intelligent network, which is the essence of our Smart City 
proposal.

Data allows us to make smarter decisions through 
knowledge, information and the facilitation of in-
formed choice. And through the use of data, the 
City of New Orleans, its community and business partners are proposing to transform this 300-
year old city into a city where all forms of trans -
portation work seamlessly! Multi-modal mobility 
by foot, by car, by streetcar, by bus, by ferry, and 
by bike, connected through technology to man-
age flow, guide investment and empower indi-vidual choice—this is at the core of our vision.
The proposal below is the product of a for-
ward-looking administration with a plan to modernize the city’s infrastructure for the inno -
vations of the next century. A suite of new appli-cations will be enabled by these infrastructure upgrades, which ultimately promise to increase 
the quality of life of citizens throughout the city.

A Model for Innovative and Equitable MobilityGoals, Measurements, and Vision 
Element Compliance
Our Smart City vision is based on achieving 
measurable goals that reflect an improving 
quality of life for our residents. 
GOAL ONE
Equitably increase economic 
opportunity to all residents through smart mobility solutions. 
In April 2014, the City of New Orleans embarked 
on a strategic effort to examine a local report 
identifying that 52 percent of African American 
working age men in the city are not working. As a result, the Mayor announced the Economic 
Opportunity Strategy, which seeks to introduce 
a new way of connecting all New Orleanians to the city’s economic growth through partner-
ships with local training providers, social ser-
vice agencies and community advocates. One major barrier for disadvantaged job seekers is 
transportation. 
A key value in our proposal is to ensure that new 
technologies are distributed equitably across 
the entire city, including all residential areas as 
well as areas frequented by our 9 million an-nual visitors. New Orleans is committed to the 
USDOT principle of Ladders of Opportunity. 
Our vision is to provide the tools to empower the poorest residents of the city to access the 
multitude of jobs that private and public invest -
ment are bringing to the city. For example, we 
propose to create mobility solutions that would 
allow a disadvantaged resident of the Treme 
neighborhood to commute every day to a job at the nearby biomedical corridor or the Michoud 
Assembly Factory in east New Orleans, where 
NASA is assembling rockets that will one day ferry people to the moon—or to Mars.
1 
A Smart City is one that effectively uses its 
resources to offer innovative solutions for 
expanding access to public transportation. 
1 http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2016/01/
michoud_orion_spacecraft_nasa.html#incart_m-rpt-2Public transit is currently accessible to 82% of households as measured by residing within a 
quarter mile of a bus route. Our proposal has 
been designed to ensure equity via improved access to new mobility services, such as on-de -
mand transit, virtual transit routes, improved healthcare transportation options, a real-time predictive trip planner, and more. Access to 
mobility is essential to economic development, 
job creation and improved quality of life. 
Measure 
 Expand new apps and shared ride/
on demand transportation options to 90% of 
households by year three of the project. Ensure 
continued focus on equity of current public transportation options.
Measure 
 Implement new modes of services 
equitably among disadvantaged and non-disad-
vantaged neighborhoods.
In addition, congestion, wayfinding, parking 
and movement throughout New Orleans have 
become more difficult with the community’s 
recent renaissance. A 2015 study by GPS manu-facturer Tom Tom ranked New Orleans the 19th-
most congested city in the country, finding that 
the average New Orleanian spends 69 hours per year stuck in traffic.
2 Our proposal includes a 
real-time predictive trip planner, dynamic park -
ing management and optimization, electric car share and bike share services to help alleviate congestion and improve mobility and parking. 
Measure 
 Launch of new real-time, predictive 
trip planner by year three. Active carsharing, 
bikesharing and AV shuttles are operational 
as described in our proposal within the three-year period.
GOAL TWO
Improve automobile, bicycle and 
pedestrian safety. 
The pedestrian fatality rate exceeds the state 
and national average and bicyclist injuries have 
more than doubled in Orleans Parish between 
2008 and 2012. In that same period, the average annual pedestrian fatality rate was 2.6 deaths 
2 http://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/trafficindex/#/list6
A new New Orleansper 100,000 residents, compared to the nation-
al average of 1.4. 
The City has implemented numerous initiatives 
in recent years in pursuit of a safe, accessible, and pedestrian-friendly transportation network. 
These include a Complete Streets Policy, install-
ing high-profile crosswalks, right-sizing wide roadways, adding pedestrian countdown signals 
at high-traffic intersections, securing federal 
grants to improve safety in school zones, adding photo-enforcement devices in school zones, 
reducing the number of motor vehicle lanes on 
select streets, and repairing sidewalks through-out the city. Data from our proposed initiatives 
will further improve safety through inherent 
safety advantages of automated vehicles and data-driven policy decisions.
Measure 
 Reduction in the city’s passenger 
fatality rate to below 2.0 deaths per 100,000 
residents by year three of the project.
GOAL THREE
Reduce the impact of climate 
change through the reduction of carbon-based pollution.
As one of the few cities in the U.S. substantially 
below sea level, New Orleans has a heightened 
awareness of the impact of climate change on 
a community. Since our proposal includes the construction of a major new data-gathering 
infrastructure for the city, including an extensive 
network of new sensors across the city’s infra-structure and an enhanced fiber network and a 
new centralized data platform to collect, store, 
analyze data, we can look at climate change-re -
lated data in a new way. This open data platform 
will help the city and third parties to monitor 
emissions, traffic congestion, and many other aspects of contribution to carbon-based pol-
lution. We can then use this data to take action 
towards reduction of this pollution.
Measure 
 Use rigorous methodologies to mea-
sure emissions and other aspects of how New 
Orleans contributes to carbon-based pollution. 
Set specific goals for committed reductions in pollution impact in all key categories. Measure  Increase electric vehicle and auto -
mated vehicle mode share and continue pursu-
ing electric streetcar expansion projects.
A New Urban Operating System 
We are proposing to implement a new 
Urban Operating System (UOS) for New 
Orleans – a fully integrated digital data-
gathering platform on which solution-based applications and new mobility options can be developed, launched 
and optimized. We are proposing a 
multi-partner, multi-modal, accessible system platform which enables real-
time optimization of everything from 
freight shipments at the Port to parking patterns at French Quarter events to new shared ride options. The platform will 
also allow for continuous evaluation and 
adjustment of policies. 
The UOS unlocks the hidden value of big data 
generated throughout our city. Our propos -
al calls for a one-time investment to build a powerful data gathering infrastructure and then explains how the centralized data platform fea-
tures analytics, security, and open data policies 
that combine to enable multiple new mobility services, modes and applications.
To make the City’s UOS a reality, we have com-
mitted to infrastructure investments above and beyond the Smart City $50 million challenge 
funds. We foresee installing fiber optics network 
capacity throughout the CBD and major cor-ridors, deploying smart sensors, cameras, and 
actuators throughout vital Department of Public 
Works assets, as well as building out data center capacity. Using this data platform, a suite of new 
mobility options and apps will be launched for 
both consumer and business users. This system would be designed to be scalable so as to allow 
it to be expanded into adjacent areas as funds 7
A Model for Innovative and Equitable Mobilityallow, eventually growing to a city-wide operat -
ing system to maximize the benefits.
The above chart summarizes the elements of 
our proposed UOS. 
The City consulted world-leading smart city 
experts at Living PlanIT SA to develop a UOS 
framework that meets the City’s needs. The UOS can be deployed throughout the network, 
at street level through to the cloud. Our current 
plan is to host the data center at the Regional Planning Commission offices where real-time traffic monitoring already exists. As the system is enhanced, off-site cloud-based redundan-
cies will likely be necessary as well. We will also 
launch a “Mobility Hub” at the UPT where Smart City project managers will oversee the new suite 
of new mobility information and options. 
We have identified a range of use cases and 
applications here, but the overall goal is to set 
the city on a course for innovation that can 
be informed by the public. By making a one-time investment to build new data gathering  Data warehouse

A new New Orleansinfrastructure, New Orleans can ensure that 
the foundation for innovation is sufficient for 
accelerated growth in the Big Easy. In the short 
term, this network can help facilitate penetra-tion of AVs (powerful sensor hubs in their own 
right) and enable the creation of a wide range 
of end-user applications. In the long term, the potential for optimization, and achieving more 
throughputs with flat capacity, is limitless.
INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
Technical Foundation and Data 
Gathering Infrastructure
The first step in the UOS implementation pro -
cess is a one-time purchase and setup of the 
necessary high-capacity digital data-gather-
ing infrastructure complete with data storage, enhanced computing power, network improve -
ments, and sensors. 
Data Warehouse
High-performance computing capacity
The data storage architecture has to be sophis -
ticated and powerful to handle the megadata 
that will be gathered, processed, and analyzed. 
Our AV consultants at CAVCOE estimate that each AV will generate 144 Megabytes of data per 
second: for a fleet of 10,000 vehicles that will 
be 1.44 Terabytes per second. A lot of this data will be processed locally to provoke interven-
tions that improve flow and reduce disruption. 
However, to achieve maximum analytic benefit by monitoring trends and anomalies to provide 
better context for decision-making, much of 
this data will need to be stored and analyzed by a sophisticated database tool.
One potential partner that has the ability to satis -
fy the extremely demanding data management, 
data analytics, and computing resource needs is 
Silicon Graphics International (SGI). SGI has been 
providing high-performance computing and storage solutions to scientists and engineers in 
government organizations, research institutions, 
and businesses for over 30 years. More recently SGI has deployed their shared-memory products 
to enterprise business customers as part of the 
movement towards in-memory databases. Of particular interest is the UV300, which can be configured with as many as 64 Intel processors and up to 64TB of memory under the control 
of a single Linux kernel. This shared-memory, 
multi-processor environment will ensure the fastest possible access to huge blocks of data. 
Allowing the UOS to run on this best-in-class sys -
tem will allow us to unlock the full potential of the 
megadata generated by a Smart New Orleans. 
SGI is also committed to extending their unique 
shared-memory architecture into the future with two following generations of UV products 
already in development that will be available 
well into the next decade; further ensuring that the solution developed today will be relevant 
and scalable into the future.
Distributed hosting architecture
A highly useful adjunct to the network and sen-
sor/equipment infrastructure is a local hosting 
layer. With the appropriate software solutions, this will provide edge-of-network autonomous 
control and protocol/data format conversion 
and allow standardized protocols to be used in higher layers while still supporting a heteroge -
neous environment beneath. Ideally, hosting hardware is suited for hostile conditions, con-nection to multiple auxiliary network types and 
remote operation. 
The provision of computing capacity for Smart 
City platforms and applications is the next 
consideration. Without analytics, data is simply 
accumulated information without intelligence or value. With real-time and historical data 
analytics, the opportunities to extract useful 
intelligence (and to grow that intelligence over time) are immense. While cloud hosting is often 
economical and popular, if a large amount of 
smart city traffic entails local processing and use of locally collected data, then local processing is 
obviously desirable for quicker access and recall 
of data. Certain classes of common and highly reusable data, such as video, are best handled 
locally due to bandwidth considerations. And 
this type of distributed infrastructure provides strong support for economic redundancy, 
autonomy, and replication solutions, which are 
more efficient than cloud or centralized solu-tions. Finally, provision of regional computing 9
A Model for Innovative and Equitable Mobilitycapacity, whatever the granularity of distribu-
tion, can help drive economic activity in the 
local area and drive in particular the develop -
ment of social innovation and vibrant Smart City 
Independent Software Vendor (ISV) ecosystems.
Enhanced Fiber Optics Network
High-speed network infrastructure is a key en-
abler of an efficient UOS. We envision installing 
fiber optics network capacity throughout the CBD and major corridors, to enable the deploy-
ment of smart sensors, cameras, and actuators 
placed throughout key Department of Public Works assets. 
Sensors, Cameras, and Other Monitoring 
Devices 
The base layer of the UOS consists of a network 
of connected sensors, devices, and cameras. 
Crucially, the AVs described in the next section 
serve as an important source of additional sensors for the network as the AVs will be equipped with 
a variety of sensors and cameras themselves, and 
will remain connected to the UOS at all times. 
The sensors deployed in New Orleans will include 
street cameras capable of monitoring parking 
and congestion situations in real time, microwave traffic sensors on the interstate, and sensors built 
into the sewerage and water network. Since many 
of the sensors necessary for a connected city are deployed on privately owned infrastructure, it 
is almost impossible to build a fully prescriptive 
sensor architecture for an existing city. However, it is possible to encourage developers, contractors, 
and solution providers to follow a consistent para-
digm as part of following the architecture. This can be simply described as:
 Ensure that no proprietary sensor networks are deployed (or if they are, an 
interoperability gateway is fitted)
 Ensure that all controlled capital 
equipment has an openly accessible 
interface
 Deploy sensors using a shared-model 
approach on the assumption that 
sensor capacities will suit all applicable 
use cases and that results will be made available to multiple systems and 
stakeholders
 Connect sensors and actuators to IP 
networks at the soonest practical (and 
economic) opportunity
 Minimize the diversity of non-IP 
connectivity (for example useful 
adjunct connectivity types are 802.15.4 
(6LowPan or Zigbee) and RS485 (2-wire serial bus))
 The UOS can already connect to many legacy sensing and actuation systems 
that exist in a city. In addition, it has 
the flexibility to be extended easily to other systems in which interfacing 
information has been declared.
This technical foundation enables the produc-
tive functions of the UOS to begin. The system 
will function as a three-step continuous im-
provement loop as described below.
UOS ELEMENT ONE
Data Collection and Access
The UOS will feature a software platform that 
manages the structured organization of stored 
data (i.e., filing information in the correct place 
for efficient retrieval) and data access requests (i.e., ensuring that only data is only being seen 
or used by people authorized to see it). 
The software platform is the key to a successful 
Smart City strategy. A scaled citywide top-level 
data platform can be built and operated ac-
cordingly as a commercial proposition (such as Copenhagen, where Hitachi is deploying the 
Living PlanIT UOS), but we propose to operate 
it in the public interest, with limited commercial opportunities leveraged to defray implemen-
tation costs. This may help encourage major 
private developments to use the same plat -
form, leading to maximum effectiveness in data 
sharing and smart applications for the utility of 
multiple stakeholders.
Data access and governance
For the full value of the data hosted on the UOS 
to be unlocked, key parts must be open and 10
A new New Orleansaccessible to individuals. However, the sheer 
scope of the data that will be collected poses 
thorny new privacy challenges. Our aim is to 
maintain a commitment both to open data principles and the respect for individuals’ right 
to privacy. 
For a successful citywide strategy to be fol-
lowed, governance—from early planning 
phases through operation—is critical to ensure 
that appropriate execution, deployment and appropriate protection of data takes place. We 
need to ensure that outcomes are optimized to 
manage what will inevitably be an evolving strat -
egy as the city grows and UOS-related technol-
ogy develops. This includes managing proper 
access to data as the City balances its goals of maintaining an open data platform that allows 
public data to drive private innovation with 
robust privacy and security measures. The City will take a proactive approach to owning and maintaining the data generated 
from the smart city project. Governance starts 
right at the beginning of the planning process – establishing principles and framework for an 
integrated approach at the outset is essential 
to avoid the inevitable siloization and sub-op -
timization that conventional planning, design, 
and construction processes will guarantee. This 
process of establishing best practices between the City, the Regional Planning Commission, 
and other key stakeholders and partners has 
already begun. 
It is important to note that a Smart City will 
generate unprecedented amounts of data, 
including potentially sensitive personal infor-mation about citizens. Experts in the field talk of 
the potential for either “data heaven,” where the 
immense potential value of data-driven deci-sion making is unlocked, or “data hell,” where

A Model for Innovative and Equitable Mobilitythe sheer volume of information overwhelms 
intended data privacy and security regulations. 
There are still many unanswered questions 
about the way that Smart City big data is owned, stored, accessed, and (potentially) sold. While 
we do not propose to answer those questions 
here, we are offering a platform that has data security and privacy protection provisions em-
bedded in its core. Our team includes big data 
analytics and simulation experts as well as public officials who have adopted their organizations 
to meet existing open data standards. As we im-
plement our proposal, we will keep data privacy issues at the forefront of our thinking and seek 
the advice of experts.
UOS ELEMENT TWO
New Mobility Services, Modes, 
and Applications
The true value of the data collected in the UOS 
is realized by the new offers and applications 
built on top of it. A group of new mobility ser-
vices and transportation modes will be enabled based on data-driven demands discovered by 
the UOS. These new offers will lead to lower 
emissions, lower fuel consumption and most importantly, efficient mobility that contributes 
to greater personal time and quality of life.
Through personal smartphone apps, cloud-
based websites, and in-vehicle data portals, 
we connect users to a variety of program 
elements through a real-time, predictive trip planning app. This powerful multi-modal app 
will enable residents to see all their mobility 
options for getting from Point A to Point B. A resident wanting to travel from Algiers across 
the Mississippi River to the employment 
hub at our newly constructed world-class University Medical Center on Canal Street will 
be able to easily travel using a single trip plan-
ner and payment system connecting ferry to bus to a last-mile solution to the doorstep 
of their new employer. Our dynamic parking 
and logistics/freight management programs will enable a truck driver delivering oysters to 
historic Creole restaurant Galatoire’s in the 
French Quarter to navigate the least-crowd-ed path to a waiting loading zone reserved in advance replacing the process of endless circling of the Quarter looking for a chance opportunity to park. The real-time, predictive 
trip planning app and dynamic parking fea-
tures will help the Uptown resident wanting to come to the Vieux Carré to enjoy some 
tunes at Satchmo Summerfest to know in ad-
vance where parking is available and its cost to make the informed choice to use public 
transit instead. 
Our proposal also includes new multi-modal 
initiatives built to connect into our UOS includ-
ing an AV shuttle route (replacing a planned 
streetcar expansion line) and preparations for an AV demonstration zone – a 10-block radius 
in the CBD in which the City funds infrastruc-
ture improvements that allow private inno -
vation and AV experimentation to happen. 
We have also identified shared-ride first- and 
last-mile solutions that can be used to increase per-vehicle occupancy rates, increase transit 
penetration in underserved perimeter neigh-
borhoods, and outline a potential use case that unlocks the potential of AVs as dynamically 
routed commuter shuttles. 
Overview of AV Demonstration Projects
New Orleans is convinced that AVs have the 
potential to transform mobility within the city and will eventually have an impact on 
almost every other aspect of daily trans -
portation. Our proposal seeks to embrace 
the early forms of AV technology in their 
limited state, while paving the way for us to 
be equipped whenever the fully unmanned capability AV systems are deployed. We are 
proposing three significant and exciting AV 
demonstration projects: A fixed-route AV shuttle, an AV demonstration zone, and a 
shared-ride AV shuttle. We will describe the 
three projects in detail following an over-view of the current context. 
AVs do not necessarily have to take the 
form of vehicles that we see on our roads and streets now. We expect there to be 
autonomous cars, buses and trucks in the 
future, but we are also considering the possibility of many other AV platforms that 
could become a daily part of our lives in 12
A new New Orleanscities by 2025. Once an AV system has been 
developed that is safe for use by the pub -
lic, then that system can be fit and cali-brated to almost any other type of vehicle platform. Additional AV platforms that are 
already in development (and that we hope 
could become a part of this demonstration in the 2017-2020 timeframe) include:
 Lightweight electric pods (could be in-line 2-seater vehicles to suit narrow streets)
 Lightweight pods that combine into ‘pod trains’ (E.g. Next
3 and the EO Smart 
Connecting Car4)
 Self-delivering bicycles
 Sidewalk friendly delivery robots (E.g. Starship
5 and Dispatch6)
The City’s transportation partner, Transdev, has 
a major corporate objective to explore, devel-
op and operate public transportation services utilizing AVs. This initiative, started in 2015, 
is giving Transdev invaluable expertise in the 
procurement and operation of AV-based public transit systems. 
Current activities of New Orleans’s AV part -
ners in this space include developing the 
necessary back-office IT system for AV man-
agement, a passenger-facing AV app, and 
trials of automated public transportation products. Transdev currently has 38 trials of 
automated, electric shuttle buses in various 
stages of discussion and planning with various partners and stakeholders in North America 
and Europe. One current project involves 
Windmill Developments and CAVCOE, who have teamed up to conduct a feasibility and 
planning study for the demonstration, trial 
and deployment of fully-automated, electric

opment in Ottawa, Canada.7 
Transdev has been in discussion with various 
AV suppliers to evaluate their vehicles, devel-
op business strategies and relationships, and maintain ongoing discussions with govern-
ment stakeholders and transit partners, which 
have already provided valuable insight into the requirements and issues faced in deploying AV-
based public transportation systems.
At the time of this submission in early 2016, the 
only commercially available AVs are low-speed 
electric shuttles from EasyMile and Navya that 
currently have limited capability on public roads. There are, however, many AVs in devel-
opment, which are also being actively tracked. 
There are strong indications that by the end of 2016 several more AV developers will be able 
and willing to provide vehicles for future AV 
demonstrations.
We also note the timely announcement by 
USDOT of President Obama’s intention to 
invest nearly $4 billion in vehicle automation in the next decade.
8 In the same announcement 
USDOT committed to providing guidance for 
AV testing and model policies for some time 
around mid-2016 that will be of benefit to New Orleans, as it develops its AV demonstration 
proposals. If the budget proposal is successful, 
then exemption authority will allow NHTSA to enable the deployment of up to 2,500 fully au-
tonomous vehicles. There is, therefore, the real 
possibility that within the 2017-2020 timeframe of this proposal, that fully autonomous vehicles 
capable of operating without a driver on board 
would be able to be used on the public roads of New Orleans. 
In addition, there is a clear synergy between the 
rapidly growing sharing economy and ride-hail-ing apps, such as between Uber or Lyft and AVs. 
GM’s announcement that they have invested 
$500 million in the ride-hailing app Lyft included

A Model for Innovative and Equitable Mobilitya plan to jointly develop an AV network.9 GM 
also acquired the select assets of Sidecar and 
launched its Maven car-sharing program in Jan 
2016.10 Uber, one of the fastest growing com-
panies in the world, is accelerating AV devel-
opment, as it recognizes that it could be itself 
disrupted by AV technology.11 Uber is already 
offering a transit-like service with its UberHop 
service in Seattle and Toronto12 and through 
emerging partnerships, has started to offer limit -
ed transit replacement services in several cities.13
As New Orleans progresses to the next stages 
of the Smart City Challenge, we will look at the 
opportunities to develop demonstrations that 
could take advantage of possible USDOT exemp -
tions for AVs and that could source AVs from 
a wide range of developers: a list that includes 
major tech companies, automakers, ride-hailing companies, etc. In short, we will provide the AV 
sandbox and invite private companies to perform 
tests and demonstrations here. 
All AV proposals will seek to take advantage of 
the benefits offered by AVs, including:
 Reduced congestion – AVs can 
optimize the capacity and availability 
of roads by balancing the flow of traffic 
and reducing sudden braking and acceleration that leads to congestion. 
 Safety – AVs are expected to reduce road crashes by over 80%, which will 
also reduce congestion on heavily used 
public roads.
 Equity – Wherever possible, the AVs will provide some level of disabled access 
and will serve areas of all income levels.

be priced equitably. Age restrictions 
will be relaxed as far as possible so as to 
serve the youngest generations.
 Electric propulsion – Reduces emissions within the city.
 Controllability – Fleets of AVs can be controlled so as to give priority to other 
travellers such as vulnerable road users 
including pedestrians, bicyclists and other active transportation modes.
 Reliability – AVs will perform consistently and won’t need unscheduled breaks and 
won’t have ‘off-days’.
 Data-gathering – AVs will be able to 
collect and then stream real-time data 
of everything that is visible in the street 
scene that, with data analytics, will have immense value to the City, local 
businesses and the public.
 Ride-sharing – With average vehicle 
occupancy during peak periods in 
most major cities around 1.2 people per 
vehicle the aim would be to utilize ride-sharing tools and policies to promote 
ride-sharing and achieve a minimum of 
1.8 people per vehicle for on-demand point-to-point services.
First AV project: Fixed-route AV shuttleThe simplest AV demonstration to stage will be a low-speed fixed-route autonomous electric 
shuttle service. The most advantageous route 
for this test would be between the UPT and the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, the 
sixth-largest convention facility in the country. 
The Convention Center supports 23,989 jobs, making it a major employment hub and driver 
of economic activity for the city. The distance 
between the two is approximately 0.9 miles.
There is significant trip demand between these 
locations, especially when major conferences 
are being hosted at the Convention Center. Intermediate stops would also serve the numer-
ous museums and other tourist attractions in 
this area. Such a high-profile AV demonstration would therefore provide an additional lure for 14
A new New Orleansvisitors and assist with revenue generation for 
local businesses and the City.
There are already commercially available AVs 
that could provide this service, and the City would work with all the other relevant regulatory 
bodies as well as stakeholders to ensure that all 
necessary regulations are in place and complied with to help ensure a safe and reliable service.
This concept has already been demonstrated 
in the real world. Transdev, the City’s transpor-tation partner, last year conducted a six-month 
demonstration in La Rochelle, France, featuring 
six electric, autonomous minibuses providing transportation between the railway station and 
the University. 
This demonstration would allow the technol-
ogy to be proved and although not reliant on 
any additional infrastructure installation, such 
as fiber or high quality wireless services, would benefit from in-situ sensors and communication 
infrastructure when it is installed.Second AV project: AV demonstration zone
A natural progression from the AV shuttle fixed-
route phase of the AV demonstration would be to 
expand transportation services into the CBD and French Quarter with on-demand AV passenger 
service using a mix of low-speed electric shuttles, 
such as two- or four-seater pods and autonomous cars and mini-vans. Ride-sharing of AVs would be 
encouraged to improve efficiency, to reduce ener-
gy consumption, and to reduce costs. We envision a true innovation sandbox where new ideas are 
continuous tested.
For commercial purposes, sidewalk friendly auton-
omous delivery robots would also be encouraged. 
These vehicles would typically be the size of a 
cooler-box and capable of carrying loads of up to 50lbs. These robots could assist small businesses 
with deliveries to addresses in the AV zone. All 
transaction details including payment, delivery lo -
cation and time would be processed electronically. 
The purpose of declaring the AV zone is to test 
new ideas, not for the city to 
prescribe which technolo -
gies should be used. Rather, its purpose is to foster a culture of innovation and 
attract private companies 
wishing to research and test their technologies. The city’s 
narrow streets, heavy pedes -
trian mode share, and strong 
transit integration present 
a dynamic opportunity for 
researchers to confront new challenges in AV testing. 
By investing in a network 
of sensors, cameras, and high-bandwidth fiber infra-
structure while creating an 
AV-friendly policy environ-ment, New Orleans residents 
will benefit from early access 
to the technologies devel-oped by private companies 
as they all seek to be first to 
market with AVs. 
15
A Model for Innovative and Equitable MobilityThird AV Project: Shared ride AV shuttle
A third phase of the AV demonstration would 
be to expand services into residential areas 
of the city to provide improved access from mixed-income housing to the downtown 
area for jobs, shopping and recreation. This 
service would be an on-demand and point-to-point service and would benefit greatly 
during peak period commuting with positive 
ride-sharing policies. It may also operate best from agreed collection nodes in the 
residential areas.
Because AVs remove the cost of the driver, 
it is expected that this type of service would 
be very affordable. In this case, the low cost 
of AV operation is compounded by routing overlapping trips in the same vehicle, creating, 
in essence, a fully automated dynamic shuttle 
that adjusts its route in real time according to demand. These shared-ride route optimization 
algorithms are available today; Transdev cur-
rently operates on-demand services with them in Washington, D.C. and Helsinki, Finland. 
A reliable AV dynamic shuttle service would 
assist low income worker job retention, and the City would investigate the benefits of providing 
a partially or fully subsidized AV service in 
certain neighborhoods. This service could serve to create a supporting structure for job 
retention, a reduction in welfare-related claims 
and increased tax contributions.
This service would ideally be provided by AVs 
capable of travelling on public roads at up to 
35 mph. Although there is a low probability of such vehicles being available in 2016/2017 , there 
is an increased likelihood that they will be avail-
able later on in the project.
Real-time, Predictive Trip Planning App
One advantage to having transportation data 
aggregated at the UOS level is that it can be re -
packaged on demand to meet the requirements of each user. We will be able to offer a real-time, predictive trip planner app that integrates every 
mode of transportation available to the user and 
offers automatically generated intermodal itin-eraries as options. In addition, the app offers a portal to convenient, real-time data aggregated in the UOS as well as payment options.
For example, the optimal route for a young 
resident from the Uptown neighborhood of Carrollton to her position as an accountant at 
Caesars Entertainment Corporation at the base 
of Canal Street could be truly multi-modal: a drive to a park-and-ride, to take the streetcar 
down St. Charles Avenue, and ride the last quar-
ter-mile on a bikeshare. These options would be presented to the user, along with other options. 
Multimodal trip planning apps are common 
around the world (a version of the feature is even baked into Google Maps). However, most 
are actually quite limited in their depth and 
scope. Our transportation partners have tak -
en trip planning to a new level following the 
successful roll out of a sophisticated multimodal 
trip planner in operation in Lyon, France and Toronto, Canada. We envision a mobility solu-
tion that takes the principles of multimodal trip 
planning and amplifies them using the UOS, with predictive traffic management algorithms 
that anticipate congestion and route users away 
from clogged roads, as well as events and road-work integration. Knowledge of delivery sched-
ules, planned disruptions, weather patterns, and 
all the other data in the UOS will make the out -
puts generated by the trip planner that much 
more powerful and relevant.
Part of our vision is that this real-time, predic-
tive trip-planning app becomes a true mobility 
portal. Over time, it will incorporate all of our 
new apps and new modes. We see it as the consumer’s “go to” app for all forms of public 
transportation, ride sharing, on-demand transit, 
virtual transit routes, dynamic parking, bike and car sharing, and healthcare transportation 
(ADA, Medicaid, HMO, etc). It is currently func-
tioning this way in Lyon (integrating all available forms of mobility including on-demand shared 
ride) and how it will function in Toronto when 
the next phase of development is complete. As citizens use the mobility app, they provide infor-
mation to the city about trip demand. This helps 
inform future transit-planning decisions and creates opportunities for new services. 16
A new New OrleansIt is important to note that this mobility app 
does not need to be strictly focused on trans -
portation. There are vast opportunities for part -
nerships with private businesses. For instance, a person planning a route ending near a coffee 
shop could be offered a discount on coffee 
by the shop owners upon arrival, generating a more personally tailored experience for the user 
and building economic value. 
Dynamic Parking Management
Dynamic parking management is another key 
element of New Orleans Smart City proposal. Harmonizing the balance of private vehicles 
with shared ride options or alternative transpor-
tation modes is key to successfully impacting mobility.
Issues of congestion, air quality, street capac-
ity, noise pollution and urban life quality all involve how we move vehicles through our city. 
The problem is potentially addressed in two 
ways. First, reduce the number of vehicles on the street network. This is addressed through 
shared ride service offers such as public trans -
port, bike sharing and car sharing. Second, 
move vehicles in and around the city more 
efficiently. This is where parking management 
becomes such an important element to the mobility equation. The average city driver spends six to fourteen minutes searching for parking. In New Orleans 
the problem is exacerbated even more with a 
historic French Quarter built before the in-vention of the automobile, a random influx of 
traffic caused by festivals and conventions, and 
a vibrant commercial district with the constant delivery of merchandise. Compounding the 
problem are the district’s narrow streets that 
make capacity increases difficult to impossible. In fact, while increasing parking capacity may 
reduce unproductive road travel resulting in 
increased road network capacity, such gains are short lived as the number of vehicles parking 
downtown increase and congestion returns. 
The City of New Orleans has attempted a policy 
approach as well, instituting a parking meter 
fee hike to $3 per hour, which has had a limited 
effect on the problem. The real solution lies in understanding the habits of those seeking to 
find parking. This requires data, not gut in-
stinct, to determine the efficacy of new poli-cies. It also requires a real-time understanding 
of parking supply and demand in order to man-
age this environment in real-time to achieve the desired result. 
Streetline, an industry leader in parking 
management, speaks to a Smart Parking Ecosystem designed to connect mer-
chants, motorists and technology. By using 
a variety of sensing technologies including 
17
A Model for Innovative and Equitable Mobilitysmartphones, video feeds, parking space 
sensors and more, real-time data can be 
gathered and communicated to potential us -
ers. The collection of this data 24/7 , 365 days 
a year also allows the measuring of demand 
variables. This is an critically important point 
in the context of New Orleans, where over 80 festivals a year, a vibrant cruise port, and a 
large influx of convention business can upset 
the “norm” of a typical day. This makes New Orleans a perfect test environment for mea-
suring the impact-parking management can 
have on the total mobility of the city.
Parking space availability data can be distribut -
ed to citizens through the real-time predictive 
trip-planning app as well as with aggregated real-time data through live information displays 
that go straight to the dashboard of a connect -
ed vehicle (through Apple’s proprietary car 
interface, for example) or in other creative ways 
developed by the private sector—a benefit of 
the City’s Open Data approach. Thus, the inter-modal itineraries provided by the user app will 
specify not only the route to take, but also the 
precise location of the available parking space that the user has been allocated. This prevents 
the aimless circling and wandering pattern ex -
hibited by drivers searching for parking spaces, 
a major driver of congestion. Drivers will no lon-
ger circle the block looking for a parking space 
that does not exist—they will travel straight to the nearest available one. 
As historical data about parking demand and 
supply is collated, the City can make more informed decisions about parking prices. For 
example, during a special event that will cause 
a surge in parking demand, the City could decrease parking prices in a nearby area and 
increase transit capacity between the parking 
area and the event location. Dynamic pricing can also be used to encourage alternative 
modes of travel. For example, imagine a sys -
tem that wants to reduce congestion by raising 
parking fees while simultaneously reducing 
ferry and transit fares. The consumer choice is 
not only based on availability but also on eco -
nomics: a powerful combination. 
In the short term, we propose to deploy park -
ing monitoring cameras that will enable these dynamic parking systems throughout the 
French Quarter and Warehouse District. 
On-Demand Transit
The arrival of smartphone ride-hailing apps 
Uber and Lyft is beginning to generate a global 
shift from capacity-driven to demand-driven mobility solutions. Even as we optimize the 
City’s fixed-route transit network using data, 
on-demand applications will soon begin to seriously compete with transit as they cut costs 
and decrease average arrival times. To compete 
in the newly competitive mobility marketplace, we believe that the City’s public transit network 
must implement a radical new offering: a dy-
namically routed bus or mini-bus that responds to trip requests in real time.
To be clear, private ride-hailing apps are an im-
portant component of personal mobility and fit in to the city’s long-term transportation plans. 
However, we feel it is paramount for subsidized 
public transit to remain a viable option for the city’s most vulnerable residents. 
Imagine a world in which passengers access 
public transit the way they hail an Uber today: indicate your pick-up and drop-off locations on 
your smartphone, and let the system route you 
onto a bus (or mini-bus depending on volume) full of people going in the same direction. Using 
big data and predictive algorithms from the 
UOS, supply is optimized for anticipated demand and adjusted seamlessly on the fly. Equipment 
is deployed to match demand, so resources are 
always balanced with supply.
We intend to implement an experimental version 
of this feature to increase transit penetration in 
the city’s underserved neighborhoods. Besides the benefit of convenience and delivering ser-
vice to underserved areas, dynamically routed 
first/last mile solutions have the effect of driving down per-passenger trip cost and increasing 
passenger vehicle capacity. Transdev already 
possesses dynamic routing capability and is in the process of conducting trials. 
Virtual Transit Routes
One benefit of the UOS is that over time it creates 
a picture of traffic flows in the city, and of people’s 18
A new New Orleansoverall traveling patterns. There is inevitably a high 
degree of overlap in single-occupancy private 
vehicles traveling from the suburbs on interstates, 
such as Interstate 10, to downtown. We want to encourage people to carpool using a virtual 
carpool feature built directly into the trip planning 
application and available as a standalone app. 
One example of such an opportunity is a pro -
totype system being developed by Transdev’s 
subsidiary Cityway that enables private car own-ers to make their morning commute via a virtual 
bus route. The driver simply indicates the path he 
takes to work every morning and the time and number of seats available. For the cost of a bus 
fare, other riders are able to book a seat in his ve -
hicle and share the ride. The driver is reimbursed 
a majority of the cost of the bus fare to help cover 
fuel costs. The resulting effect provides increas -
ing mobility options for underserved residents 
and increasing the number of occupants per 
vehicle. Trip demand data generated by users 
of the mobility app will help inform the way this program is rolled out and optimized. 
The end result is an unlimited number of “virtual 
fixed routes” that augment the existing transit net -
work and increase passenger vehicle occupancy. 
Electric Carshare Program
Carshare programs have already demonstrat -
ed their effectiveness in reducing private-car 
ownership. Two out of five Corporate Zipcar members indicated that they sold a vehicle or 
postponed a vehicle purchase due to joining 
Zipcar.
14 Our goal is to create a system that re -
duces vehicle ownership and carbon emissions. 
The best way to do this is to offer a carshare 
system that only features electric vehicles. 
This is not an unprecedented idea. Paris and 
London already feature electric carsharing 
networks, and Blue Indy, in Indianapolis, has rolled out 50 of its planned 500 electric vehicles 
in the city, to go with a network of 125 char-
ger-equipped parking spaces.
Carshare companies continue to express inter-
est in the New Orleans market, but the lack of a 
14 http://innovativemobility.org/wp-content/up -
loads/2015/07 /Zipcar_Corporate_Final_v6.pdfsystem allows us to build a fully electric system 
from the ground up. The Paris and London sys -
tems have both dealt with growing pains, includ-ing issues about who maintains the charging sta-tions and vandalism problems. New Orleans will 
be able to build a system that has already learned 
from these mistakes. 
Because of the high capital start-up costs, it 
is unlikely that the City would implement the 
EV carshare system directly without assistance from a company like Vulcan, Inc. Therefore, 
a private company with expertise in the field 
would be selected to operate it with close su-pervision and integration to the UOS. 
Such a program will be of considerable value to the 
AV demonstration program as it expands as it is very likely that most, if not all, of the AVs used will 
themselves be battery electric vehicles (BEVs).
Bikeshare Program
New Orleans currently lacks a bikeshare pro -
gram such as Citibike in New York. We plan to 
implement such a program as part of our Smart 
City proposal. Summary
This graphic summarizes our suite of 
proposed mobility services, shared 
ride options and apps that build upon the data infrastructure to greatly im-
prove mobility in the city.

A Model for Innovative and Equitable MobilityWith 25-45% of bikeshare trips replacing vehicle 
trips nationwide,15 a well planned bikeshare system 
that integrates with transit can both displace vehi-
cle trips and increase transit usage while providing 
a healthy first or last mile transit option. 
The conditions are ripe for bikesharing to have a 
big impact in New Orleans. The city already pos -
sesses over 100 miles of bikeway, with 60% of the 
city’s 72 neighborhoods served by at least one. 
Our 2.1% bicycle modeshare is twice as high as 
any other Southern U.S. city, but still far too low.
The City has already internally produced a 
feasibility study on bikesharing programs eval-
uating the best options for New Orleans. The City’s bikeshare feasibility study found that the 
city’s dense street network lends itself to bicycle 
traffic by keeping maximum automobile speeds low with frequent stops. In short, New Orleans 
is ready to support a successful and sustainable 
bikeshare system.
While stop locations have not been finalized 
throughout the city, a key first station will be placed 
at UPT to maximize the station’s multimodality. 
We must take special care to ensure that the 
equity and workforce development results of 
bikeshare implementation are maximized. While some bikeshare programs, such as Washington, 
D.C.’s Capital Bikeshare and London’s Santander 
Cycles, have succeeded in capturing commuter modeshare with over 2/5ths of system trips being 
work-related, over 65% of trips on Brisbane’s City 
Cycle program were found to be for leisure or sightseeing. The racial makeup of bikeshare users 
in Washington, D.C. and London hints at inequity 
as well. In Washington, only 3% of capital bikeshare users are black, in a city of 49.5% black population. 
In London, 88% of bikeshare riders are white com-
pared with 55% of the overall population. 
Ensuring that New Orleans’s bikeshare system 
serves the entire community will require for-
ward thinking and a higher initial investment to provide service in all neighborhoods, but will 
be necessary in the long run to meet a standard 
of equity through this critical component of affordable transportation. The City’s bikeshare 
15 2013 Unpublished city bikeshare feasibility studyfeasibility study initially identified nine neigh-borhoods not recommend for bike share de -
ployment in phase one. While it would be more expensive to expand the system to include all nine of these areas, we will ensure that they be 
carefully considered before implementation so 
that the benefits of the system are distributed throughout the entire city. Thoughtful integra-
tion with the transit system and a cash payments 
system are two ways to increase the system’s utility to poor or underbanked residents. 
While it is possible that a private company could 
operate the City’s bikeshare system, the fea-sibility study recommended an administrative 
non-profit organization that would manage the 
system in its entirety for the public good. 
As noted in the AV section, automated systems 
can be applied to any platform and we are aware 
that self-delivering bicycles are already in develop -
ment by China’s Baidu.
16 The Elcano Project, out of 
the University of Washington, is also developing a 
self-driving tricycle. 17 
One of the biggest challenges for the efficient operation of bikeshare programs is daily com-
muter flows resulting in bikes being left in clus -
ters that are not coincident with demand. This 
results in constant manual relocation of bikes to 
sync with demand, which costs the operator time and money. However, a self-driving, self-deliv-
ering AV bicycle could dramatically improve the 
bikeshare paradigm as it could be summoned by a user on their smart device, paid for electroni-
cally and left anywhere within a defined zone of 
operations primed for relocation as needed. 
In addition, within an AV zone (as described 
above) bicyclists will feel safer as the AVs will be 
extremely courteous and patient drivers. This process will dramatically lower the barrier to 
entry for many would-be users that are cautious 
of trying bikeshare.
Such improvements around both rider safety 
and convenience are expected to have a positive 
influence on bikeshare ridership and potentially

trike-for-under.html20
A new New Orleansto be transformative for active transportation. 
Increased ridership also creates a virtuous circle 
as regular bike riders have, on average, improved 
health, have longer working careers and place a lower burden on health services.
New Orleans and its partners will actively moni-
tor developments of self-delivering and self-driv-ing bike technologies and incorporate them into 
the bikeshare program if possible.
Logistics and Freight Management
The same principles that apply to the parking 
management application also apply to logistics and freight delivery management, particu-
larly with regard to the Port of New Orleans. 
The port moves 31 million tons of freight and over a million passengers per year, but faces 
numerous operational challenges that reduce 
efficiency. Just last week, an 18-wheeler trying to pass through the French Quarter caused a 
massive disruption when it became stuck under 
a low hanging balcony while trying to turn from Barracks Street to Burgundy Street.
18 
A lack of information and synchronization often 
contributes to a logjam of different modes in-
tersecting at the banks of the Mississippi. After being stuck in traffic on Interstate 10, truckers 
seeking to pick up freight from the port often 
encounter frustrating delays while nearing the port on surface streets. Trucks tend to arrive at 
the same times (early morning and late after-
noon), creating a bottleneck of trucks at the entrance to the port campus. To make matters 
worse, railway lines pass directly in front of the 
port’s entrance—whenever the train is passing, all trucks are blocked from entering and exiting. 
The Port Authority is in the process of testing 
a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution for freight truck Automatic Vehicle Location. Even 
in isolation, the benefits of such a system are 
obvious: synchronization of scheduled truck-load pickup times with shipment arrivals from 
the port, traffic management as trucks seek to 
leave the port simultaneously, and historical data on traffic trends. 
18 http://www.wwltv.com/story/news/2016/01/27 /18-wheel-
er-stuck-french-quarter/79413188/?c=nMoreover, when linked up to the rest of the UOS, this AVL data becomes truly power-
ful. With real-time congestion and roadway 
accident information, trucks can be diverted into clearer roads to ensure on-time arrival if 
needed. UOS integration would also allow for 
some outbound freight shipments to be pos -
sibly redirected on to the canal railroad and 
delivered to the port by rail, eliminating the 
need to traverse congested surface streets entirely. The system enables multimodal 
freight just as it encourages multimodal per-
sonal mobility. 
At a local level, the software that would pow -
er the dynamic parking system could allevi-
ate tremendous amounts of delivery-related congestion in the French Quarter. Currently, the 
district’s numerous bars, shops, and restaurants 
require frequent shipments of perishable goods and other items from delivery trucks, which of -
ten block the narrow streets and restrict traffic. With a bird’s eye view of the current parking situation, the City could pre-assign certain 
spaces and times for business delivery needs, 
optimizing traffic flow and eliminating a great deal of congestion. 
Another promising delivery and logistics ini-
tiative of sidewalk-based automated delivery robots are enabled through the City’s proposed 
AV demonstration zone.
Improved Healthcare Transportation
Medicare and hospital data show that demand 
for outpatient services at hospitals is increasing nationwide.
19 Connecting New Orleanians to 
the University Medical Center, a state-of-the-
art, $1.1 billion facility completed last August, is 
an important objective of our proposal.20 The 
UOS will enable new efficiencies in transporta-
tion unlocked through reduced per-passenger 
trip costs, higher per-vehicle occupancy, and increased availability of wheelchair-accessible 
AVs to those who need them. Further, the big 
data generated by the UOS promises to help

optimize paratransit operations, driving down 
costs and improving service. The bikeshare pro -
gram offers another means of accessing health care for some consumers. 
A Mobility Hub Housed in UPT
While the data processing backend of the 
project will be housed at the Regional Planning 
Commission, the physical symbol of New 
Orleans’s new mobility area will be the historic Union Passenger Terminal in the CBD. A major rail and intercity bus hub served by streetcar 
and bus transit lines, UPT is an important portal 
for people entering and exiting the city. Its importance will only be strengthened when the 
proposed commuter rail linking Baton Rouge, 
New Orleans and the seven parishes along the Mississippi River alignment is installed.
The City sees UPT as a symbol of the new 
multi-modal New Orleans and the hub of two 
Disadvantaged Residents

A new New Orleansnew proposed programs, a bikeshare system 
and an Electric Vehicle-only carsharing program. 
The City owns not only the UPT property but the 
land under the nearby, elevated Pontchartrain Expressway as well, allowing the City to make 
quick and expedient decisions on the rollout of 
these programs. From this Mobility Hub, oper-ations teams would ensure that all the planned 
mobility services and apps are functioning well 
and delivering promised services to customers with high standards of quality. 
Future Services Built on Open Platform
The horizontal, open architecture of the UOS 
enables development of new applications and 
use cases. When proper access and anonymiza-tion protocols are implemented, the capacity 
for individuals and independent software ven-
dors (ISVs) to create new innovations on top of the UOS Smart City framework is unlimited. 
A key space in which the UOS will enable power-
ful innovations is in energy management. A build-ing enabled with intelligent sensor infrastructure 
and connected to the UOS could improve energy 
efficiency by avoiding unnecessary lighting and heating/cooling of common and unoccupied 
areas, and better understanding of energy losses 
(parasitic losses in appliances not in use, unnec-essary lighting / HVAC, inappropriate device set -
tings, etc.) enabled by sensors, data collection, and analytics. A “smart building” enabled with appropriate sensors can be optimized over time 
to efficiently suit the needs of its occupants. 
The optimal application strategy is to enable an 
open market for applications running on the 
software data, control, and application-enabling 
platform described above, while providing a safe and secure way of doing this by exposing 
data via application processing interfaces (APIs). 
This addresses various needs from multiple stakeholders and isolates by specific vertical 
solution areas. The majority of these applica-
tions run on mobile devices. However, some more specialized solutions run on dedicated 
hardware, TVs, touchscreens, web browsers, 
and control rooms. A local ISV ecosystem can be grown to support these applications, but 
existing ecosystems, which support Smart 
City platforms, can also be leveraged with applications imported from similar city develop -
ments—a core value proposition for coherent 
software platforms is portability of applications.
UOS ELEMENT THREE
Analysis, Optimization and 
Knowledge Sharing
While the applications and services above are 
at least in part enabled by the data hosted in 
the UOS, they also generate data themselves. 
The time and location of every trip-planning app information request through the app will 
be recorded—over time giving a picture of 
how and when mobility decisions are being made. Observed patterns and trend analysis in 
bikeshare utilization can lead to a fuller picture 
of commuter patterns. Peak parking demand times can provide insight to help combat con-
gestion. As more new services are implement -
ed, more data is generated—and all of it is fed 
back into the UOS. 
The data generated through these new ser-
vices can be analyzed to discern trends, devel-op future management strategies and develop 
informed public policy. From our proposed 
Smart City Hub located at the UPT, our Smart City team will have access to the data measur-
ing the pulse of the city for analysis. It will be 
used to develop new transit options, realign transit services and service levels according 
to demand, become the basis of new pricing 
policies for both publicly accessible transit and privately used parking, provide the rationale 
for supporting physical roadway infrastructure 
improvements including signalization and streets, as well as measuring the effectiveness 
of current policies and practices. This project 
is about analyzing and understanding data so that we can take action.
The data generated by UOS-enabled products 
can be analyzed to help continuously improve products themselves, creating a positive feed-
back loop through which the city’s disparate 
processes continue to develop and mature with time. 23
A Model for Innovative and Equitable MobilityData Analysis and Simulations
An important benefit of the UOS is the ability to 
analyze the terabytes of data that are generated 
by the network of sensors across the urban land-scape. Our partner, Living PlanIT, has expertise in 
the field of big data analysis and simulation. 
For example, using a process called Building 
Information Modeling (BIM), the team analyzed re -
al-time sensor data in London City Airport showing detailed passenger movements throughout the ter-minal. By observing pedestrian walking patterns and 
simulating how pedestrian flows would be affected 
by environment changes (i.e. turning a bookstore into a coffee shop), the team was able to ideate a 
new configuration for the terminal that increased 
efficiency, productivity, and passenger satisfaction. 
It is not hard to imagine the applicability of that 
technology here. The exact same BIM process 
should inform the redevelopment efforts at UPT. Other pedestrian-heavy areas in the city should 
be subject to the same sort of analysis as well. It 
is easy to apply the same simulation principles to transportation and infrastructure decisions. 
Building a virtual model of passenger flows with-
in a bus route would help make transit service decisions easier, or help determine where on the 
sidewalk a bikeshare station should be placed. 
Smart Cities are, in principle, cities with the 
tools to constantly re-evaluate and re-optimize 
themselves. Plugging a simulation model 
into the UOS enables those evaluations to happen constantly on a highly sophisti-
cated level.
Knowledge Sharing
While New Orleans is unique in char-
acter it is not unique in its challenges. A Smart City of New Orleans will have 
lessons learned, successes to share 
and failures to avoid. The Merritt C. Becker, Jr. University of New Orleans 
Transportation Institute (UNOTI), a des -
ignated University Transportation Center 
by USDOT, along with other national in-
stitutions, will observe, analyze and write 
about our Smart City experience to share with other city leaders and planners. 
This effort is not a “one off” but rather a movement and as such must be documented 
and shared with cities across the country.
Research Partnerships
We recognize that the developments outlined 
here when taken together represent an unprece -
dented leap toward the Smart City vision. The fact 
of the matter is that no one knows what the city 
will look like once all of these elements have been 
implemented. For that reason we have enlisted Jim Amdal, a Senior Fellow of the Transportation 
Institute at the University of New Orleans to assist 
with analyzing the short and long-term impact of these initiatives as they are implemented. It is 
important that others are able to learn from the 
transformational process we put ourselves through.
Proposal team member Living PlanIT has ex -
isting professional relationships with Harvard 
University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to analyze and perform research on 
their Smart City demonstration projects across 
the world. To the extent that Living PlanIT con-tinues to be involved in our proposal, Harvard 
and MIT researchers will be involved as well. 
Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) 
Architecture
The Regional Transportation Management 
Center (RTMC), where the Regional 
24
A new New OrleansPlanning Commission is located, is a state-
of-the-art facility, which utilizes Intelligent 
Transportation Systems (ITS) applications to 
design and aid in regional coordination such as facilitation of communication among driv-
ers, traffic operations staff, emergency re -
sponse personnel and other agencies to max -
imize the use of existing roadway throughout the region. At this facility, traffic management 
staff monitor traffic conditions throughout the region in real-time through the use of 
various ITS tools, such as traffic cameras 
and vehicle detectors. Roadway conditions are communicated with drivers and emer-
gency responders through use of Dynamic 
Messaging Signs, Twitter, and the 511 Traveler Information System. The technologies em-
ployed at the RTMC assist with the congestion 
reduction, aid in the prevention of accidents, and shorten the response time for emergency 
personnel to respond to the accidents. This 
resource will be an essential component in fulfilling our vision for thorough sourcing and 
innovative application of transportation data. 
Of the eight core Service Packages in the 
ITS Architecture, our team’s objective is to 
utilize them all. Five will have a major role in 
the system design and implementation, and the other three will also be involved but to a 
lesser extent.

and construction management
Both the State of Louisiana and the City of New 
Orleans have developed regional and local ITS 
architectures, which are consistent and useful. In 
addition, New Orleans’ Regional Transit Authority (RTA) operates fleets that include buses, street -
cars, paratransit services, and ferries. These are primarily part of the Public Transportation and Traveler Information service packages although the Advanced Data Management and Vehicle Safety service packages are also involved.
Due to the efforts of USDOT in accelerating 
the introduction of connected vehicle (CV) technology, many established Advanced Traffic 
Management Systems (ATMS) vendors have 
upgraded their ATMS to incorporate CV func-tionality. The New Orleans RTMC is home for 
the ATMS in this project and will play a critical 
role for any future AV and CV initiatives.
In addition, the team fully understands the 
synergies between AVs, CVs and EVs and the 
convergence of these three technologies into ACE vehicles (automated, connected and elec-
tric). Hence, the Connected Vehicle Reference 
Implementation Architecture (CVRIA) will be very relevant and useful to the proposed Smart 
City Challenge deployment, as will the standards 
related to EVs.
The New Orleans team commits to using the 
CVRIA, the National ITS Architecture and rel-
evant standards in its detailed description and specification of the systems involved in the pro -
posed deployment. The team fully understands the importance of utilizing the architecture and standards and of documenting any issues that 
require attention.
Background and Context
Demographic Profile of New Orleans: A Mid-
Sized City
With a Census-designated place population of 
343,829 according to the 2010 census, New Orleans 
falls squarely into the mid-sized city tier defined by 
the USDOT’s Notice of Funding Opportunity. With a Census Bureau-defined land area of 169.42 square 
miles, New Orleans’s population density is 2,029.4 
people per square mile. The New Orleans –Metairie – Hammond Combined Statistical Area had a total 
population of 1,413,882 in the 2010 census, with 
the 343,829 residents of New Orleans comprising 24.32% of the total MSA population.25
A Model for Innovative and Equitable MobilityCharacteristics that Align New Orleans to 
Smart City Challenge
Unprecedented investment in road 
infrastructure 
Today, there is more roadwork now any time in 
recent history. After taking office in May 2010, Mayor Landrieu hit the reset button on the City’s 
negotiations with the federal government on 
Hurricane Katrina-related damage. Since then, the City has met with FEMA over 825 times producing 
$946.7 million more in new funding to rebuild and 
repair public facilities and streets. So far, the City has completed 247 road projects totaling $342 mil-
lion and resulting in 111 miles of new roads. Right 
now, there is over $150 million of road construc-tion either in design or under construction across 
New Orleans. This infrastructure work includes 
FEMA-funded Recovery Roads, Community Development Block Grant funding and City bond 
funded projects. In 2015, the City completed over 
40 road projects valued at $80 million, represent -
ing over four-times the amount of infrastructure 
work performed by the City annually, on average, 
prior to Hurricane Katrina. 
A robust existing public transportation system
In service to the Regional Transit Authority, the 
City’s private-sector transportation partner, Transdev Services, Inc. operates a well estab -
lished, highly used transit system, including a fleet of 138 buses, 64 paratransit vehicles, and 66 streetcars providing over 19 million trips per 
year. The St. Charles streetcar line is the oldest 
continuously operating streetcar in the world. In fact, New Orleans has the most extensive 
streetcar system in the entire U.S., which is 
widely used by locals and visitors (See Table 1). A major expansion of the streetcar system is 
currently underway, to be opened later in 2016. 
Notably, the streetcar system connects to over 90% of the bus network, making the city a ter-
rific example of intermodal connectivity in the 
U.S. Transdev also operates the New Orleans Ferry service across the Mississippi River.
In 2015, RTA buses and streetcars ran 5.24 million 
revenue miles over a route system serving 75 square miles. The RTA has approximately 2,300 
bus and streetcar stops and 300 passenger shel-
ters. Since 2009, transit ridership has increased seven percent annually due to a thoughtful restructuring of routes to specifically connect 
transit-dependent populations to major em-
ployment centers in the Central Business District (CBD), Mid City, and the French Quarter. The RTA 
is currently in the process of improving and mod-
ernizing vehicle-location (GPS) data collection by procuring a new CAD / AVL system. 
Paratransit Service – RTA’s paratransit service 
provided service to almost 1,200 active reg-istrants, using both RTA owned lift equipped 
vehicles and contractor owned and operated 
accessible minivans in FY2011.
Ferry Service – Transdev operates pedestrian 
ferry service between Algiers Point and down-
town New Orleans as well as Algiers and Lower Chalmette, which allows for connections into 
the RTA system for added mobility. 
Other Transit Operators – As a regional transit 
authority, the RTA also operates local bus service Table 1

ticipated to start airport express service in Spring 
2016 between the City of New Orleans and the 
New Orleans International Airport.
Further, the RTA system connects to two other 
fixed route public transit operators. St. Bernard 
Transit (SBURT) and Jefferson (Parish) Transit (JET) in downtown New Orleans, Wilty Terminal in 
Gretna and at other transfer points. JET operates 
eight bus routes that connect with RTA services. 
Other mobility options 
The number of people bicycling and walking in 
New Orleans is up. New Orleans was recently ranked a “silver” bicycle friendly city and 5th 
highest of major US cities in the percentage of 
commuters bicycling to work. New Orleans was also ranked a “bronze” Walk Friendly Community. 
Over 100 miles of bikeways now reach more than 
half of the city’s 76 neighborhoods, including the Lafitte Greenway, a 2.6-mile bicycle and pedestrian 
trail and green corridor. Safety for all road users—
drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians—remains the top priority for the Mayor.
Conducive environment for proposed strategies
Over the past decade, the City of New Orleans has focused on delivering innovative strategies 
to revitalize its public transportation network. 
These range from adding new transportation capacity, such as two new streetcar lines and 
the transformation of historic Union Passenger 
Terminal (UPT) into a multi-modal transporta-tion hub to strengthen economic opportunity 
and revitalize a downtown corridor, to our 
launch of electronic trip planning for transit rid-ers. We have an ambitious plan for future expan-
sion of all mobility options, including walking, 
biking, bus, streetcar, paratransit, and possibly BRT services, and continued digital services for 
passengers, such as our new RTA mobile ticket -
ing service “GoMobile” which allows purchase of 
transit tickets from a smartphone.
In August 2015, Mayor Landrieu revealed the 
world’s first Resilience Strategy. Guided by 100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by The Rockefeller 
Foundation, Resilient New Orleans combines 
local expertise with global best practices to confront our most urgent threats and seek ways to redress our legacy of inequity and risk. One section of our approach is transform city 
systems where we propose to redesigning our 
regional transit systems to connect people, employment and essential services. 
The City of New Orleans has prioritized a com-
prehensive strategy to connect disadvantaged job seekers and business to new opportuni-
ties. This strategy includes collaboration with 
some of the region’s largest employers and job centers. The City also continues to foster 
entrepreneurship by creating partnerships 
with the private sector and non-profit orga-nizations, such as the NOLA Business Alliance 
and the Idea Village, a vibrant 501(c)(3) with 
a track record of identifying and retaining entrepreneurial talent in New Orleans. The 
Brookings Institution has reported that startup 
business creation in the City of New Orleans has exceeded the national average by 56% 
from 2009-2012, and by 33% over fast-growing 
Southern cities like Houston and Atlanta.

This network of roads collectively allows for 
accessible urban neighborhoods in our city and 
affords us an opportunity to further optimize their utilization and levels of service through 
data-enhanced management. 
Continuity of committed leadership
The City of New Orleans benefits from seasoned 
leaders with deep experience in the planning 
and execution of ambitious initiatives, skilled in the coordination of committed parties with var-
ied interests. Mayor Landrieu remains commit -
ted to creating opportunity for all New Orleans residents. 
Our Metropolitan Planning Organization 
benefits from the energy and expertise of 
dedicated commissioners and from Executive 
Director Walter Brooks, who is responsible for creatively managing a constrained budget 
and balancing the repair of our street and 
traffic signal systems with innovations for our roadway system.
Furthermore, Transdev’s Public-Private 
Operating Partnership (PPOP) contract with the RTA was recently renewed for another five-year 
term. Transdev Vice President and CEO of New 
Orleans operations, Justin Augustine, is a native of New Orleans and deeply committed to the 
City’s success. Among his accomplishments 
have been major improvements in both quality of service and efficiency of operations. He has 
also pioneered training programs to develop 
young leaders and nurture a new generation of craftsmen and mechanics to support RTA’s historic streetcars. The PPOP contract structure 
is a unique business model that has enabled the 
entire transit system to flourish, with Transdev bringing systems, processes, and innovations 
from its transit operations in 20 countries.A commitment to integrating with the 
sharing economy
We view Transportation Network Companies 
(Uber, Lyft) and other sharing economy start -
ups as an integral part of the menu of mobility 
options available to residents of New Orleans 
and as an important complement to the public transit system. The strategies outlined in this 
proposal will further this trend by establishing 
the city as a laboratory of innovation for mobili-ty and sharing economy solutions. 
A commitment to open data
In 2013, RTA released its General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) on its website (www.norta.
com) to create open machine readable data 
that application developers could use to create futuristic, user-friendly trip planning apps. The 
strategies proposed in these applications are 
designed to expand the public’s capacity to use transportation data and to support the user’s 
ability to make informed decisions. This propos -
al goes even further to leverage the power of 
the terabytes of data being generated typically 
by a Smart City. 
Current data collection 
The data currently collected by the city falls into 
five categories.
 Operational and maintenance
– 311 calls for service data for road 
maintenance, signage repair, street 
light outage, etc.
– Monthly census of operational 
streetlights (conducted by 
contractor)
– Weekly tallies of potholes filled and 
catch basins cleaned. Potholes filled 
by “pothole killer” are geo-located.
 Road conditions– Department of Public Works is 
currently collecting data on street 
conditions
 Traffic safety– 911 calls for service for traffic-related 
incidents
– State-maintained LACRASH database 
for all traffic, pedestrian, and bike 
accidents28
A new New Orleans Taxi data
– All rides for metered taxi rides in 
Orleans Parish
 Public transit data
– Real-time automatic vehicle location 
data
– Passenger counts for each route 
operated
Even as the City improves its data collection, we are committed to extracting its maximum value, having already united different city agen-
cies in the review of this data to inform policy 
decisions. 
The Mayor’s office has instigated a new safe -
ty initiative that brings together the Police 
Department, the Department of Public Works, the Regional Planning Commission, and the 
Louisiana Department of Transportation. All of 
these agencies meet regularly to review safety 
data as part of a broader effort to align New 
Orleans with the ten U.S. cities selected as part of the Vision Zero Network. 
Another City-led data initiative is our monthly 
Quality of Life statistic review meeting. Every month, the Mayor’s Office, the Department 
of Public Works, the Sewerage and Water 
Board, Department of Parks and Parkways, the Department of Sanitation, the Mosquito, 
Termite and Rodent Control Board, and the 
City’s Chief Information Officer meet to re -
view 311 call data and analyze trends in citizen 
requests. Much scrutiny is given to the City’s 
ability to respond to the requests and deliver the services and information citizens require. 
Team Makeup and Capability to Execute
This proposal has been developed by a team 
of New Orleans public officials and leaders 
working with a group of international experts 
on Smart City technologies, building off the initiatives and programs we have begun over 
the past six years. Local team members in-
clude leadership from the City of New Orleans Mayor’s office, the Department of Public 
Works, Network of Economic Opportunity, 
the Sewerage and Water Board, the Regional Planning Commission, the Port of New Orleans, 
the City Planning Commission, the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority, the Regional Transportation Authority, and the New Orleans 
Business Alliance. 
We have partnered with cross-disciplinary 
experts in the Smart Cities field from all over 
the world. Our team includes Living PlanIT, the world’s foremost provider of Internet of Things 
architecture solutions, based in London and 
Portugal, and the Canadian Automated Vehicle Center of Excellence, an internationally recog-
nized thought-leader in the socio-economic 
impacts of AVs providing consulting services, information, analyses, recommendations and 
other support to all stakeholders who will be 
involved in the launch of AVs and/or who will be impacted by their arrival. 
The city’s transit operator, Transdev, leveraged 
its international subsidiary Cityway, a lead-ing provider of trip planning technology and 
smart mobility solutions including dynamic bus 
services and virtual commuter routes. Transdev also tapped assets from its Paris-based Digital 
Factory team, an internal unit dedicated to 
researching the future of transportation and, in particular, AVs. As the current RTA operator 
for at least the next five years, Transdev brings 
a continuity of vision for the future of transpor-tation in the City throughout the performance 
period of this grant. 
Other team members include the University 
of New Orleans and Spartan Solutions, a 
leading transportation consultancy based in 
Washington, D.C. Silicon Graphics International, a world-leading data analytics solution provider, 
is a potential team member as well. 
The city officials and team members assembled 
here have a proven track record of achieving 
improbable successes. Our team includes veterans 
of the post-Katrina rebuilding effort, who led the charge in bringing New Orleans back as a viable and 
desirable place to live. In 2013, the City, RTA, and 
Transdev completed the Loyola Streetcar expansion on schedule just before the Super Bowl thanks to 
funding from the USDOT. Since then, $2.7 billion of 
new transit-oriented development has occurred along this new expanded streetcar route. We expect 
similar results along the expansion currently under 
construction, scheduled to open late in 2016.29
A Model for Innovative and Equitable MobilityThe top challenges New Orleans faces are sim-
ilar to those of many cities: congestion, water 
management, inequality, urban rejuvenation 
and access to jobs. Additionally, our street network is often dense with small blocks and 
narrow lanes, especially near the most popular 
destinations, compounding congestion prob -
lems. The layout of the city, tucked between the 
Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, pre -
vents further outward sprawl. The city has sunk 
over seven feet since its founding 300 years 
ago, creating a myriad of challenges.
In other words, no city appreciates the challenge 
of doing more with less than New Orleans. Our 
proposal represents our best effort to optimize 
the infrastructure we have using data and tech-nology, and an innovative plan to implement new 
infrastructure that will power the next century. 
The attached letters from city councilmembers and 
local leaders demonstrate the commitment and 
the excitement that the entire city shares about our 
vision. We have total confidence in our ability to ex -
ecute the plan described in this document, during 
the grant performance period and beyond. This 
grant represents an unprecedented opportunity to alter the City’s trajectory for the years to come.
Technical, Institutional, and Policy Risks
Dreaming up new innovation and ideas is 
inevitably risky. We are confident in our team’s 
ability to mitigate the risks associated with the following challenges. 
Technical risks
Unproven AV technology – Establishing an AV demonstration zone in the city’s center opens 
up opportunities for public safety concerns 
(AV software malfunction causing a pedestrian crash, for example).
Data privacy – The sheer scope of data gener-
ated by a Smart City poses new challenges. Even anonymized data carries privacy implications, 
as highly specific conclusions can be drawn for 
historical location data over time. Balancing this risk with our commitment to open data for 
all, we will work with international data science 
experts to navigate this challenge as we develop our proposal.Unprecedented scale – A city-wide database operating system like the UOS has never been 
implemented on such a large scale. It is likely 
that the system will pose unforeseen challenges throughout its deployment. 
Policy and institutional risks
Local level policy and institutional risks are min-imal given widespread institutional buy-in and 
participation among key stakeholders and city 
officials. The letters of support attached to this proposal are evidence of this. 
Our dynamic parking proposal has the potential 
to be controversial, as a recent $3/hour parking price imposition was extremely unpopular.
There is work to be done to implement an AV 
policy framework that is conducive to research and development. The city aims to base its 
guidelines off of the recommendations issued 
by USDOT over the course of this year. 
Opportunities to Leverage Federal 
Resources 
The City has multiple opportunities to leverage 
Federal resources.
First, the City is prepared to deploy assets like 
the UPT land and adjacent property under the 
Pontchartrain Expressway for the redevelop -
ment of UPT as a mobility hub. 
Second, the Sewerage and Water Board is in 
the process of administering large amounts of federal grants for related infrastructure projects 
that work in synergy with the Smart City efforts. 
Third, City transportation partner Transdev has 
provided and is prepared to provide significant in-
kind contributions to the project, including hun-
dreds of man-hours of labor and the mobilization of digital assets from their global parent company.
Fourth, we plan to leverage private industry 
partners, including the hospitality and enter-tainment industries (which stand to benefit fi-
nancially from the improvements outlined here) 
to assist with related capital outlays. 
In addition, we will seek to obtain all available 
federal grants which offer funding in related 
areas. Another potential option is to re-allocate existing grants toward the Smart City effort.30
A new New OrleansConclusion
Winning this grant would be transfor-
mational for our city. While we are proud 
of our current trajectory, a boost of this 
magnitude would allow us to make a quantum leap towards becoming a Smart City, as opposed to the incremental gains 
we are on a path to achieve.
We offer this document as a vision for the future 
of a resilient city. We are positioned to build 
the future city: one that is responsive to our 
delta and coastal geography, locally forged and globally connected, and founded on the equity 
of opportunity and social mobility.
Today, as we approach our 300th anniversary, 
we look toward the future and set a course for 
the city’s fourth century, a future where every 
facet of the city runs in harmony with the others and where every citizen is empowered to live 
the life they choose. Our plan will also reduce 
congestion and our dependence on foreign oil. 
We are excited and humbled by the opportunity 
to advance this vision through greater technical 
insight and understanding. It is our greatest hope that you will find this application aligns with the 
highest aspirations of the Smart City Challenge. Table of Compliance

 I. MONTGOMERY’S E -TRANSIT VISION 
 
Strategically located on the Alabama River, in the geographic center of Alabama’s Black 
Belt and on the North/South transect from Chicago to Mobile, Montgomery is a S MART 
City with a tested and vetted commitment to the advancement of civil and human rights 
in the streets, schools, structures and living systems of the city.   
 
Montgomery has one of the most significant public transit systems in the nation’s history 
and with this competition it could also have one of the most significant public transit 
systems in the nation’s future. Transit equity is defined by Montgomery, Alabama.  
 
Montgomery has transitioned well in the trajectory of American cities throughout the 
20th century. The city as a center of peace and human rights has proven to be resilient 
and shows strong capacity to lead in advancing sustainable urbanism.  As the state, 
federal and judicial center of the State of Alabama, Montgomery sets precedents. 
 
As a university city, with a great diversity of professional programs from the Air Force 
Air War College to the HBCU Alabama State University, there is a vibrant, well-
educated millennial and international population. The proposed E-Transit system 
upgrades, easy to access and customize, will transform the quality of life in Montgomery 
for all in measurable ways. The synergy exists between City, civic and business 
leadership to produce a winning S MART City demonstration that significantly increases 
safety, mobility, efficiency, and sustainability with climate positive solutions and 
innovations. 
 
The Montgomery team has the professional capacity to deliver and evaluate the 
performance of the S MART City demonstration and to produce a replicable model. An 
evaluative matrix and metric system able to analyze, synthesize and derive projective 
models from the proposed M data network, will be established to identify a suite of DOT 
strategies for handling the challenges and leapfrogging the mid-sized American city 
toward 21st century concepts of and approaches to urban mobility, safety, efficiency, 
employment, sustainability.  
 
The challenge that Montgomery confronts in its pursuit of equitable urbanism and 
SMART transit is that the historic legacy of inequity and separateness continues to play 
out in the lives of its citizens through antiquated spatial planning models, transportation 
infrastructure financing and the presence of a burdened criminal justice system. With a 
Gini coefficient of 4.7, Montgomery is on par with Mexico City, Guatemala City and 
Abidjan in terms of equity of access to the prosperity of the city.  The challenge is to 
1 
 
 provide multiple open pathways of urban mobility that connect community members to 
each other and networks of opportunity, making public transit an empowering and 
desirable part of life.  
 
Montgomery’s capacity to ensure just access to the equitable city is undeniable.  
 It is committed to advancing the larger goals of sustainable community development 
through climate-positive solutions and innovations. Most importantly, Montgomery 
values the fundamental relationship between mobility and work, and the ways that equity 
of access to mobility and the internet of things can positively transform individuals, 
neighborhoods and whole cities. As a city that dares to name its first street car the 
Lightening Route, with the conviction of justice to change the Constitution, Montgomery 
understands the serious purpose of the S MART City Challenge, and will rise to the 
occasion to show the world how E-Transit and the DOT can sustain our cities in the 21st 
century.  
 
The proposal for the City of Montgomery advances the M as an integrated e-transit 
system that encourages car-light and car-free experiences of the City with incentives for 
all riders/users. The proposal simultaneously enhances the safety, connectivity and 
convenience of its neighborhood stops and shelters with sensor/beacon technology and 
Wi-Fi capacity.  Three E-commuter campuses will extend the services and capacities of 
the M-network into the commuting environment, encouraging positive citizen to citizen 
and citizen to transit engagement and experience. 
 
A new sensor-based M card will connect users with the expanded M data network that 
will include all real-time traffic and transit data as well as access to the internet of things 
Montgomery. The proposed M-card and M-data network function in this proposal to 
collect/ distribute and analyze/synthesize data, respectively. The system will be designed 
to facilitate SMART transit of all kinds, to improve the experience of its users, and to 
reward participation making the SMART experience of Montgomery the most desirable. 
 
The analytic framework for the extended M network system wide improvements 
described in this proposal will align with MAP-21 performance-based decision-making 
protocols. The increased level of detail and query-ability provided by the distributed 
sensor technology and user-based input portals proposed for the M will be analyzed 
across the platforms of existing data management systems to allow greater flexibility and 
adjustability to current and future initiatives. Scenario modeling can be tested against real 
time transportation system data, environmental, commuter preferences and work force 
trends to inform a dynamic transportation planning environment for the city and the 
region. New, cross sector indices from a wide variety data models will be supported by 
2 
 
 the M data network and facilitated by the increased capacity of the Montgomery Cyber 
Connection. Data sets and analytic summaries will be made available to system users via 
the M app portal and via data sharing screen functions at the e-commuter campuses and 
at selected SMART Shelters. Citizen engagement and involvement in the decision 
making process will be facilitated by push notified, city wide citizen challenges to “move 
the needle” in real time concerning a variety of transportation, environmental and 
commercial issues. 
 
Implementation and management of the data analytic portion of this project will be 
administered by the joint efforts of the Director of Planning, the Director of  
Montgomery County/City unified IT with support from the MCC data administrative 
unit.  Governance, oversight and reporting for this project will be provided by the 
Montgomery Metropolitan Planning Organization.

Montgomery Alabama is a mid-sized capital city in the global south with a dense and 
diverse urban population. Montgomery is home to nationally recognized public and 
magnet high schools, ten universities and a growing tech and creative sector.  College or 
graduate school enrollment is 31.2%. The median resident age is 34.5. The city 
demographics include 56.6% African Americans 37.3% Whites 2.2% Asians 3.9 % 
Hispanic or Latinos and 0.2% American Indians or Alaskan Native. These statistics 
reflect a youthful, international, well-educated population, a key component of a SMART 
City.   
 
Comprising a land area of 155.38 sq. miles Montgomery has a population of 205,764, 
occupying on average a ratio of 1289.5 persons/per square mile. Mo ntgomery City’s 
FIPS code is 51000.  The percentage of the urbanized area occupied by the 2010 
population was 76%. The per capita income was $24,409. The median household income 
is $43,702 (in 2013 inflation adjusted dollars), the third highest in Alabama.  The median 
home cost is $162,770.  
 
Commuting to work statistics for the City of Montgomery in 2010 reveal an auto-oriented 
population with great opportunities to increase ridership of public transit, e-commuting, 
ride-sharing, car-light and car-free pathways. Of workers 16 years of age and over, 
totaling 90,573 - 84% drove alone in a car truck or van compared to 11.1%   of the 
population who carpooled. 0.8% of the workforce commuted to work via public transit. 
1.8 % walked, bicycled or used other means while 2.3 % worked from home.  Mean 
travel time to work was 19.0 minutes.  
 
Montgomery is the home to the Intellectual and Leadership Center of the U.S. Air Force 
(Maxwell Air Force Base); and Information Technology Leader for the Department of 
Defense (Maxwell Gunter Annex). Montgomery has a thriving automotive manufacturing 
market with the only American Hyundai Motors plant; a vibrant $1.3 million-per-day 
tourism market and a diverse retail market. The cutting-edge medical community 
workforce is expanding. And as a growing cyber center, civilian technology jobs are

 III. SMART City Context in MGM 
 
a. Existing public transportation system 
 
The M , Montgomery’s public transportation system in its current incarnation is described 
in section 4.4.1 of the Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP 2040).  The M is currently 
owned by City of Montgomery and operated under a management contract with First 
Transit Group. The M operates16 fixed route lines, a demand-response para-transit 
system (MAPS) for elderly and disabled citizens, and is in partnership with Commute 
Smart offering carpool ride share in and between the cities of Montgomery, Mobile, 
Birmingham and Huntsville. The M TransLoc app currently provides riders with real-
time traffic and route data. The holistic transit plan for the City of Montgomery currently 
includes specific provisions for Smart Growth Development, pedestrian and bicycle 
interfaces, equity and environmental justice.  
 
b. Environment that is conducive to demonstrating proposed strategies 
 
Central Alabama has a unique geographical advantage. As the capital of the State of 
Alabama, Montgomery Alabama is uniquely poised to capitalize on energy, 
manufacturing and technological innovations that will characterize the early 21st century. 
The quality of life in Montgomery is high. Regional connectivity and affordable housing 
in one of America’s emerging centers of business growth is accessible and equitable.  
 
c. Continuity of committed leadership and capacity to carry out the demonstration 
throughout the period of performance 
 
The stability and longevity of Montgomery’s current civic and political leadership is a 
testament to Montgomery’s ability to o vercome past divisiveness and eagerly bring 
forward the best ideas for the region’s youth.  Alabama is beyond all else committed to 
the success of their children.  Long-term planning for the city and region envision and 
will deliver urban and regional growth and community development defined by 
sustainable land-use and efficient, affordable, desirable public e-transit systems. 
 
d. A commitment to integrating the sharing economy 
 
Montgomery has recently enacted ordinances to facilitate the role of app-driven ride 
share companies such as Uber and Lyft. Further, the M plans to expand the bicycle 
sharing network in conjunction with multi-modal nodes that integrate public transit and 
the next generation of shared technology to rewrite the relationship between mobility and 
5 
 
 work in the 21st century. Local organizations and social-media based groups such as 
Connect MGM  and Montgomery Capital Cool  create and update open platform networks 
to connect SMART Montgomery innovators and entrepreneurs via public events and 
opportunities to collaborate. Citizen-led groups and non-profit organizations promote 
neighborhood revitalization in partnership with city agencies. The Planning and 
Development departments promote SMART growth and sharing economy opportunities 
in the downto wn core and across Montgomery’s diverse neighborhoods.   
 
e. A clear commitment to making open, machine-readable data accessible, 
discoverable and usable by the public to fuel entrepreneurship and innovation.  
 
There is no more clear form of commitment that the advancement of Alabama’s first 
cyber city exchange created in partnership between Maxwell Air Force Base, City of 
Montgomery, Retirement Systems of Alabama and the Universities.

established businesses and educational facilities will provide a forum for civic 
engagement and the development of new e-commuter defined industries. Untapped 
opportunities for collaboration, innovation and entrepreneurial relationships will be 
fostered via the M e-commuter campuses.  
 
 
11 
 
 Vision Element #10:   Architecture and Standards 
 
A. Montgomery is ideally situated to maintain and extend it’s ITS architecture and 
standards.  Interstates 65 and 85 and well as other US and state highways run through 
Montgomery makin g ITS an important component to state and federal highway 
initiatives.  Interstate 65 has dynamic travel time and traffic information messag e 
boards currently operating within the Montgomery area and the same dynamic 
message boards will be built along Interstate 85 within the next two years.  These 
technologies along with other advances regionally and statewide create a unique 
opportunity for the Montgomery Area to be at the forefront of ITS Architecture. 
 
B. The City of Montgomery through its Traffic Engineering department currently 
operates a Traffic Operations center which can view 300 intersections throughout the 
City of Montgomery to  evaluate traffic flow, signal timing, and potential causes of 
accidents.  It is the desire to incorporate this ability to every signalized intersection in 
the City of Montgomery.  This will be accomplished with the addition of resources to 
provide more fiber optic cable for the transportation network.  The City of 
Montgomery is also actively investigating the upgrade of street lights to LED staring 
with the downtown core.  
 
Vision Element #11:   Low-Cost, Efficient, Secure, and Resilient Information and 
Communications Technology (ICT) 
 
A. The establishment of the Montgomery Cyber Connection, the State ’s first Internet 
Exchange puts the Montgomery area at the forefront of affordable, adaptable, 
efficient, secure and resilient technology.  Instead of information being sent from 
Montgomery to Atlanta only to return to Montgomery, that information whether it be 
an email, text message, or phone call will now be almost instant. The resulting 
Internet Exchange will allow companies to transmit data faster and cheaper and those 
savings will make their way to consumers. More online and cloud storage space will 
be available as more servers will be added to power the internet exchange.  
 
B. The integration of Ma xwell Air Force Base with their security and privacy protocols 
will make the Internet exchange one that highly values the safeguarding of data, 
privacy on not just the Internet but physical security of devices and the ITS 
architecture.  
 
 
 
12 
 
 Vision Element #12: Smart Land Use 
 
A. The City of Montgomery is always seeking to use new strategies and practices that 
advance land uses which encourage the development of a more connected 
community.  Through this effort, Montgomery Downtown Central Business District is 
concen trating more growth downtown to attract more persons to live, work and play 
within the CBD.  Long Range land use considerations are given to the City as a whole 
and each council district and neighborhood association are studied to evaluate trends 
and for making necessary changes to keep each place in Montgomery unique to itself 
while expanding the range of transportation, employment and housing choices.  
 
VI. Risks and Risk Mitigation

operates a Traffic Operations center which can view 300 intersections 
throughout the City of Montgomery to  evaluate traffic flow, signal timing, and 
potential causes of accidents.   
 
g. Smart Grid Technology  
The City of Montgomery currently offers two free and public electric vehicle 
charging stations.  One is located under the train shed at historic Union Station 
downtown and another is located at the corner of Commerce St. and 
Tallapoosa St across from the Renaissance Hotel and Conference Center 
downtown.  
 
IX. City Data 
 
The City of Montgomery collects various sources of data based upon the need.  For the 
purpose of this demonstration, the ridership of the M is collected per route, that 
information is then used to determine the frequency of routes. The M also now uses the 
TransLoc app to give the public access to where each route is located at that time to best 
plan their route. This technology combined with Traffic Engineering ITS Traffic 
Management System gives the City of Montgomery travel and ridership data access that 
can give other departments such as public safety and public works more information 
about potential improvements to the current transportation system.  Partnerships and the 
collection, management and limitations on sharing of data will be investigated with each 
15 
 
 partner as they are added to ensure each partner is satisfied.   Therefore each policy or 
agreement will be on an individual basis. 
 
X. ITS Strategies and Feedback Loops 
 
The City of Montgomery developed an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) Plan to 
install a fiber-optic cables network and ITS components to more effectively manage 
traffic and emergency response.  The City in partnership with ALDOT and FHWA, 
complies with National ITS Architecture.  A Montgomery Area ITS Architecture Plan 
was prepared for ALDOT by consultants in December 2003.  ALDOT provides ITS 
funding that requires an 80/20 or 50/50 (federal/state/local) match for ITS projects.  The 
State, Federal, and local governments also provide project oversight.  In FY 2006 a FTA 
capital grant was awarded in the amount of $47,500 for the development of an automatic 
vehicle locator system (AVL) for MATS and paratransit software. The system provides 
for increased efficiency with real time location information for passengers and operations 
staff to determine next bus arrival times for improved effectiveness, efficiency, safety, 
and security. 
 
The first goal was to install a fiber-optic infrastructure and upgrade traffic control 
equipment for an operational closed loop system with communication between ALDOT 
and the City of Montgomery’s Traffic Engineering Department.  The key components of 
the ITS is to: 
 Construct a fiber optic network (closed loop system with communication) or purchase 
and use a wireless technology network, 
 Provide real time information on incidents and traffic congestion, 
 Provide motorist information via dynamic message signs, internet service providers, 
TV stations, and other communications methods, 
 Adjust traffic signal timing along West, South, and East Boulevards and various other 
locations as needed to improve traffic flow, 
 Manage incidents more efficiently and improve  incident response time, and 
 Use incident and congestion information to more effectively provide and manage 
MATS transit service using Global Positioning System (GPS) units on MATS buses. 
There are several longer-term proposed ITS infrastructure projects for the Montgomery 
study area.  One such project is for the City of Montgomery ’s Fire and Rescue 
Department and Police Department EMS services.  The proposed project will allow the 
EMS to utilize the future ITS infrastructure to monitor traffic for incidents and improve 
16 
 
 incident management/response time to more efficiently clear vehicle crashes and traffic-
impeding incidents.  Other future ITS plans include: 
 Installation of dynamic message signs around the perimeter of the cities of 
Montgomery and Prattville to better inform incoming motorists of existing traffic 
conditions and incidents.   
 Potential creation of a City of Prattville TMC, with installation of ITS Cameras 
and vehicle detection units.  
 Linking all vehicle detection units with ITS to have a live feed back to the TMC’s 
in the area.  
 Linking the City of Montgomery downtown signal controllers with either radio or 
fiber optic cable.

 1) Vision for the Port Huron/Marysville Smart Cities Collaborative  
 
Introduction  
The cities of Port Huron and Marysville, Michigan are rich in history, natural resources, cultural 
assets, and people. The fifth busiest international border crossing  (Blue Wa ter Bridge)  in the 
United States and transportation assets that include deep water ports, mainline rail, airports and 
major expressways, St. Clair County is a major region for global economic trade . Positioned 
downstream from the Port of Halifax, and conne cted by Canadian National (CN)  Rail and the 
401/I -69 corridor, presenting increased cross -border trade and challenges related to logistics, 
freight movement, and traffic congestion.  
 
With numerous manufacturing facilities located within a four -hour radius of 25 auto assembly 
plants,  thriving industrial parks, and their proximity to critical logistics infrastructure, Port Huron 
and Marysville face a number of challenges related to supporting global supply chain trends of 
the future.  
 
Connected and autonomous  technologies present great opportunities to develop and test 
innovative solutions to address known challenges, create efficiencies, and establish best practices 
that can be replicated by communities across the nation and beyond.  
 
Overview  
Cities across th e globe are leading a worldwide paradigm shift in how they use their resources 
more sustainably and how they leverage data and innovation in making their communities more 
resilient and livable. With aging infrastructure and public policy that is decades be hind, it is 
imperative that communities across the United States take a proactive approach to implementing 
innovative solutions to facilitate open government, connected infrastructure, and a sustainable 
future.  
 
The Port Huron/Marysville Smart Cities Coll aborative aims to be a leader in Smart City 
transformations that position  similar  communities throughout the United States to be more 
efficient, resilient, and connected. The citie s of Port Huron and Marysville are not world cities. 
What these cities  are, in fact, is “ Any Town, USA.” From coast to coast, the American landscape 
is dotted with small - to-medium sized towns that must face the challenges of evolving into  
smarter cities. Virtually e very county in every state has its version of Port Huron and Mary sville.   
 
Moreover, these cities are uniquely positioned at the nexus of the nation’s fifth largest 
international border crossing with more than $40 billion in commerce  between the U.S. and 
Canada every year. T he size of these communities, combined with it s proximity to critical 
infrastructure, an international border crossing, and a Great Lakes connecting waterway, make 
the Port Huron/Marysville area the perfect location to implement “smart” initiatives, to develop 
and test innovative new technology  models , and create a road map for replication and  scalable  
implementation for  any community across the country . These innovations will be tested and 
implemented across jurisdictional boundaries, providing boundless opportunities for additional 
data sharing and c ollaboration.

 Communities  today  acknowledge the need to create a more res ilient economy and environment.  
In order to protect sensitive environments and critical resources, communities must work 
together with many partners to better protect and manage reso urces and to make service delivery 
more efficient for our citizens.  
 
Vision Statement and Guiding Principles  
The Port Huron/Marysville Smart Cities Collaborative has a grand, yet attainable vision:  
 
The cities of Port Huron and Marysville will  create a re silient and sustainable 
environment that will enable our citizens, businesses, and institutions to discover, 
innovate, and prosper in an open and collaborative way, facilitated by efficient 
government, good urban planning, connected infrastructure and emer ging technologies , 
which integrate to develop  knowledge and experiences to share across our communities 
and beyond.  
 
The Port Huron/Marysville Smart Cities Collaborative is grounded in eight Strategic Planning 
Principles:  
 
1. Improve Livability : Ensuring our communities provid e vibrant, efficient, and enjoy able 
experiences that create a high quality of life.  Further, ensuring  our citizens have access to 
a range of housing and transportation options, recreational amenities, and resources to 
improve overall heal th and wellness.  
2. Improve Connectivity:  Enhancing  the movement of people and goods by improv ing our 
transportation network,  implementing smart infrastructure solutions, and ensur ing a high 
degree of digital connectivity in our communities.   
3. Ensure Community  Sustainability:  Protecting and preserving  our valuable natural 
resources, cultural amenities, and sensitive environments for future generations, as well 
as plan for growth and development that promotes fiscal sustainability.  
4. Promote Economic Prosperity:  Diversifying  our tax base so our communities are 
fiscally sound and educat ing our people to prepare them for 21st century job 
opportunities. Promoting and support ing sustainab le economic development, which 
includes  fostering entrepreneurial growth, facilita ting industrial development, revitalizing 
our downtowns, and creating high -skill, high -wage jobs.  
5. Improve Safety and Security:  Ensuring  the ongoing safety and security of our citizens, 
our critical infrastructure, and community assets.  
6. Develop Community Re silience:  Taking  a multi -sector , multi -jurisdictional approach to 
planning and preparing for change, disruptions, and shocks to our community systems. 
Increasing  our resilience in order to decrease sensitivities to climate change and extreme 
conditions, re duce exposures to damage and loss, and increase our adaptive capacity.  
7. Foster Open Systems and Innovation:  Embracing  a more open and transparent 
government, support ing open data, and foster ing a balance between private and public 
information.   
8. Support Lear ning:  Collaborating  with community partners to improve educational 
attainment, individual development, and community engagement within our 
neighborhoods.

 Current Challenges  
1) The Blue Water Bridge and the M-25/M -29 corridor s experience sig nificant periods o f 
congestion, more idling vehicles , and increa sed vehicle emissions. Target objective s are 
to optimize traffic flow and reduce emissions.  
 
2) There are three drawbridges in Port Huron, all of which cause seasonal traffic delays. The 
drawbridges operate on a t imed frequency schedule , causing more congestion, i dling 
vehicles , increased vehicle emissions , and increased bridge operation . Installation  of 
smart infrastructure on the drawbridges could lead to a mor e efficient flow of traffic, 
reduce carbon emissions from idling vehicles , and prolong the life of the bridges . 
 
3) This region  collect s and track s a significant amount of data from many sources that could 
be useful to citizens, researchers, developers, urban planners , and transportation 
engineers. This data, t hough, often is isolated in various departments, exists in multiple 
formats , or is not fully exploited. The target objective in addressing this challenge is 
timely, local, accurate information about the conditions in the community and organizing 
that data for better analysis.  
 
4) As international border communities, there are inherent homeland security and public 
safety issues that affect our way of life. The Blue Water Bridge connecting Michigan to 
Ontario, Canada is one of the busiest border crossings in Nor th America, with a steady 
stream of truck traffic traversing our communities. Each day, 47 million pounds  of 
hazardous materials are being transported through our communities on I -94 and I -69. The 
target objective is to utilize  sensor technology on existin g infrastructure could help 
officials have a better idea of the materials being carried on a particular truck and provide 
emergency management professionals  and first responders  with key data to protect the 
health, safety, and welfare of the community.  
 
5) Tourism is a huge component of the local economy. In 2015, the Blue Water Convention 
Center opened adjacent to the Blue Water Bridge in Port Huron, along with a nationally -
branded hotel; however, they are  not located in the central business district. Communi ty 
leaders have been seeking ways to better connect visitors at the Convention Center to the 
downtown. A targeted  solution to this challenge to implement  a bike share program in 
downtown Port Huron, as well as potential deployment of electric golf carts or  automated  
urban shuttles that can carry people to and from the CBD.  
 
6) A critical challenge for all communities going forward will be to engage their citizens to 
find out what they want in a Smart City and to make them informed, well -connected and 
smart cit izens. The concept of a Smart City is relatively foreign to the average citizen. 
The targeted objective is to reduce any notion s that  connected and autonomous vehicles, 
data sharing, and other innovative infrastructure solutions are a threat rather than a 
community benefit.  
 
7) As waterfront communities, it is imperative that Port Huron and Marysville must aspire 
to become more resilient communities. Through connectivity, the availability of big data, 
and automated technology, these communities can develop the  necessary tools and  
4 
 adaptive capacity to build resiliency and mitigate the effects of climate change  in a timely 
and more cost -effective manner.   
 
Proposed Demonstration Project  and Implementation  Goals  
Through the Smart Cities Challenge, we propose to tr ansform Port Huron and Marysville into a 
living laboratory where our project partners can develop, model, and test the practicality and 
feasibility of various connected smart infrastructure solutions to improve the quality of life for 
people in cities and towns across the United States.  In particular, we aim to  accomplish the 
following : 
 
1) Civic Engagement Pilot Project : Through a partnership with the Michigan State 
University School of Planning, Design, and Construction , we will survey the local 
population a nd local businesses about their visions, desires, and expectations of a Smart 
City. This survey will be tailored to answer to the 12 vision elements of the USDOT 
priority areas. With the results of this survey pilot, we are informing the full proposal and 
are also demonstrating the application of multiple vision areas.  Keeping the public 
informed and connected will help in moving the demonstration forward, while creating 
an environment where civic entrepreneurship and innovation is fostered and fueled.  
Informed citizens will be more open to engage in connectedness and use the data in 
creative ways to address transportation challenges. This push towards civic engagement 
would move towards an open governance platform, through which smart cities 
communicate.  
 
2) V2X Sensor Infrastructure Deployment:  Sensor deployment on infrastructure assets in 
Port Huron and Marysville will allow for critical testing and modeling of autonomous 
and connected vehicle technologies. Working with public and private sector partners and 
service providers, we will install sensors on traffic signals, drawbridges, light poles, and 
other optimal locations in order to facilitate data collection and maximize development 
opportunities. An extensive fiber network managed by the St. Clair County R egional 
Educational Service Agency (RESA) exists throughout the targeted development zones. 
There are 25 miles of fiber throughout Port Huron and Marysville. RESA will work with 
technology vendors to facilitate data captur e, storage and IT maintenance. This 
arrangement will support infrastructure management with support of engineering partners 
within the municipality system to establish “in house” knowledge and familiarization that 
can be offered to surrounding municipalities throughout the county and poten tially state 
of Michigan.  
 
3) Data Collection/Data Analytics:  This aspect of the project involves data analyses 
crossing qualitative and quantitative methods ranging from single case studies to big -data 
analysis. Professors from the Michigan State University School of Planning, Design, and 
Construction will use their personal expertise in the area of transport analytics and garner 
additional support from MSU’s statistical and data analytics programs so as to suggest 
varied ways of collecting, analyzing, storin g and sharing data.  For example, the team  
would be able to recommend ways to assess potential benefits of solutions and ways to 
assess performance measures and their impacts on the priorities of the challenge.  
  
5 
 4) Open Government/Open Data:  Making the connect ed data open is critical to maximizing 
the realization of the potential that will invite and welcome software engineers and app 
developers to innovate the defined Smart City Projects. The objective will be to open up 
development dialogue to widen the brain storming between citizens and businesses how 
data can be used to improve their operation and functions. Additionally, Port Huron and 
Marysville will embrace open government by making data publicly available on their 
municipal websites.  The resulting develo pments will also be tracked and monitored for 
analysis. The project team will examine how these developments will contribute to 
improving speed, efficiency, and engagement that can be used directly to address growth 
and utilization challenges that communit ies are expected to face in the future.  
 
5) Resiliency Planning Toolbox : The project team will partner with Land Information 
Access Association (LIAA), a non -profit community planning organization, to 
collaboratively plan for economic and environmental resili ence in our sensitive shoreline 
communities. This project will provide the greater Port Huron/Marysville community 
with a suite of  tools and guidance to collectively build resilience and more efficiently 
coordinate efforts across jurisdictions. When applie d to community planning, resilience 
thinking results in a community that is more engaged and coordinated at all levels, more 
nimble and responsive to needs and opportunities, and proactively prepared to weather 
the unpredictable but inevitable challenges t o come. The project will include educational 
and outreach activities to improve  adaptive capacity and  public understanding of climate 
impacts and resilience.  
 
6) Bike Share Pilot Project:  Project partners will test out implementation and operation of a 
publi c bike share program in downtown Port Huron, connecting people to key 
destinations, such as the central business district, the Blue Water Convention Center, the 
St. Clair River/Bridge to Bay Trail, and St. Clair County Community College.  
 
7) Tourist Shuttle P ilot Project:  The scope of this project will provide autonomous shuttle 
transportation from the Blue Water Convention Center to the Blue Water Area Transit 
Hub in Downtown Port Huron . This technology will also be expanded into another pilot 
project that wi ll develop delivery of goods potential in dense areas.  
 
8) Development of a Smart City “Roadmap”:  Again partnering with the Michigan State 
University School of Planning, Design, and Construction , this will be a pilot project to 
transfer knowledge and experien ce to other communities and academic institutions. 
Being professors at a research institution, the aspect of knowledge transfer is an integral 
part of the profession.  This works for the Smart City Challenge project in two ways: the 
integration of the lates t existing knowledge on smart cities has to become part of the 
planning efforts and the dissemination of the results of the projects in order to transfer 
knowledge to other cities to maximize the funding impact. Our partnership can help share 
results and p ublicize efforts through academic and professional circles by publishing 
papers and presenting at professional conferences.  As one of the “specific goals” of the 
Smart City Challenge (NOFO -Beyond Traffic  2045 ), knowledge transfer is critical so that 
other cities in similar situations can reproduce the same systems and services.

 3) Port Huron and Marysville, Michigan: Community Characteri stics 
 
Overview  
The Cities of Marysville and Port Huron are located about one hour from the city of Detroit in 
the heart of the US Automotive Industry and members of the Automation Alley Technology 
Corridor in St Clair County Michigan.  
 
The City of Marysv ille has about four lineal miles of international water frontage along the St. 
Clair River.  An interchange to I -94, a major freeway, is located approximately one -quarter mile 
west of the Marysville city limit,  allowing convenient and quick access to the hi ghway s ystem 
and providing a sound modern rural infrastructure.  
 
The most obvious attribute that both cities have  is access to and views of the St. Clair River.  As 
noted above, there are about four lineal miles of river frontage in Marysville . Of this,  roughly 
one-third is open to the public. The rest is either used for single -family dwellings or occupied  for 
industrial use. Recognizing the value of its waterfront, Marysville  has worked aggressively to 
stabilize  the shoreline, assure public access and prov ide the amenities necessary to allow the 
waterfront to  function as a park.  
 
The Gratiot corridor is the focus of commercial development within Marysville . Because Gratiot 
serves as an important highway link, a number of commercial uses have located along Gratiot 
that derive much of their business from passer -by traffic rather than relying on nearby residents. 
The positive aspect of this is that Marysville residents have convenient access to more goods and 
services than would be expected for a community of this population. On the negative side is the 
need to manage traffic and the inconvenience of traffic jams. The Gratiot corridor presents an 
ideal location to imple ment and test V2X  technologies, as does M -29 – a state trunkline that runs 
parallel to the St . Clair River and becomes M -25 in Port Huron to the north.  
 
The City of Port Huron, stretching for seven miles along the shore of the St. Clair River and the 
base of Lake Huron, is an international border crossing marked by the Blue Water Bridge. Port 
Huron's stunning waterways and  diverse annual events make it a year -round tourist destination. 
The city is an island, connected to the mainland by a network of drawbridges that contribute to 
traffic congestion on the city’s road system – particularly in the s ummer months.  Port Huron’s 
downtown is a mix of historic buildings and new developments, blending street -level restaurants 
and shops with upper -level lofts, studios, and apartments.   
 
Transportation Network Conducive to Demonstrating Proposed Strategies  
Port Huron  and Marysville are home to a number of important components of the regional 
transportation network, including the international  Blue Water Bridge, Interstate s I-94 and I -69, 
and the M-29/M-25 corridor  that runs through the central business distr ict and connects Port 
Huron to Marysville and  other communities in Michigan’s Thumb.  
 
The international Blue Water Bridge is a critical international  transportation gateway linking 
Commercial Trucking and personal automobile traffic crossing the border of t he United States of 
America and Canada.  The initial span was completed in 1938; an additional span was completed 
in 1997.  It is also the fifth busiest crossing between the U.S. and Canada, and the second busiest  
8 
 truck crossing between the two countries.  This gateway remains a critical access point for 
passenger vehicles and freight traffic betwee n St. Clair County and Canada. On a typical 
weekday, approximately 10,000 cars and 6,000 trucks use this facility . 
  
CSX Transportation and CN North America Railro ad provide Class I rail service to the region.  
The Class I rail routes provide U.S. freight connections to Canada through the International 
Railroad Tunnel in Port Huron, as well as service to industrial sites throughout Michigan. In 
2012, nearly 233,000 l oaded containers and nearly 165,000 empty containers were shipped 
across the United States -Canadian border. The CN North America’s primary line runs east to 
west through the communities of Port Huron, Emmett, and Capac. The CS X line runs from 
Marine City t hrough St. Clair, Marysville, and Port Huron.  
 
Port Huron and Marysville also have extensive non -motorized transportation resources that can 
be integrated into the Smart City program. The 54 -mile Bridge to Bay Trail runs through both 
cities as it connects Port Huron to the southern border of St. Clair County. The Island Loop 
National Water Trail was the first designated National Water Trail in Michigan.  The Island Loop 
is part of a countywide system of water trails known as the Blueways of St. Clair.  
 
Exist ing Public Transportation System  
The Blue Water Area Transportation Commission (BWATC) provides transit services to several 
communities within St. Clair County, including the city of Port Huron and the townships of Port 
Huron, Fort Gratiot and Burtchville.  BWATC operates a combination of fixed route, on-demand 
response and contract services.  BWATC currently operates seven  regularly scheduled bus routes 
and a shopper shuttle  within the City of Port Huron and Fort Gratiot Township. Although there 
are fixed st ops along each route, the service operates a flag system where necessary to allow bus 
riders to catch the bus anywhere along route. Headways are generally 45 minutes and all vehicles 
for the fixed route service are lift or ramp -equipped and are equipped wi th bicycle racks.  
 
A commuter service runs to Chesterfield Township, a community in northern Macomb County. 
This service also links up with the Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation 
(SMART) buses so commuters can make a connection to thei r final destination in Southeast 
Michigan and/or downtown Detroit.   
 
Why Should Port Huron and Marysville be Selected as Smart Cities?  
As noted above, these two cities are similar to the majority of communities in America. Based on 
the 2010 Census, there w ere 285 cities in the United States that had populations of 100,000 or 
more. There are roughly 3,144 counties or county equivalents in the U.S., and almost 20,000 
incorporated places. The majority of communities in the US have populations below 100,000. 
All of these places face the same challenges as Port Huron and Marysville in planning for and 
becoming smart cities. Port Huron and Marysville are perfect locations to implement the 
proposed pilot projects and identify best practices and new knowledge that c an be transferred to 
any community in the U.S.   
 
Our communities provide a real -world environment to test and advance smart innovations at a 
manageable scale – to tap into the potential of what a Smart City in the United States could be.   
  
9 
 The majority of Port Huron and Marysville  residents fall in  the “baby boomer” generation (born 
1946 -1964 ). As the baby boomers move into their fifties and sixties in the next decade and their 
sixties and seventies in the following decade, there will be a significant incre ase in the already 
expanding elderly population. Over the next 20 years, the cities plan ahead for an aging 
community  obvious needs will include improved emergency services, availability of health 
facilities, affordable housing, and transportation  validati ng the “ Beyond Traffic 2045 ” that public 
policies are needed to strengthen the coordination of human service transportation services to 
meet the needs of older adults and people with disabilities. The proposed Smart City  project will 
specifically identify how Port Huron and Marysville can improve livability for aging residents  
and other sensitive populations  through the implementation of Connected S mart infrastructure.  
Port Huron and Marysville, along with numerous other public, private and nonprofit partne rs, 
have a long history of working together. Leadership from both cities is committed to supporting 
the Smart City Challenge  and leveraging the gained experience throughout the St Clair County 
Region . Both communities also work closely with St. Clair Count y government. Together, this 
partnership will see the demonstration project through to its completion. Collectively the county 
is committed to transforming its  communities into smart cities  and serve as a technology 
diffusion platform for the Greater State  of Michigan . There is a committed and strong believe 
that the collective efforts possess the greatest potential to accomplish the greatest knowledge and 
value with the most efficient considerations of cost and timing.  
 
Developing vibrant and resilient co mmunities requires a comprehensive approach, recognizing 
that critical community systems routinely cross jurisdictional  boundaries and the familiar silos of 
interest. Community resilience is greatest when multiple jurisdictions, sectors and interest groups  
are communicating, cooperating and coordinating their actions. Resilient communities identify 
and leverage their strengths while continuously pursuing the identification and cultivation of new 
strengths. Port Huron and Marysville are coastal communities t hat will provide strong 
opportunities to study climate impacts on the environment and the economy. As part of the 
demonstration project, best practices, lessons learned, and strategic goals can be developed and 
replicated for other communities and institut ions.

 5) Alignment with USDOT Vision Elements  
 
Vision Element 1: Urban Automation  
A data rich and connected Smart City provides the ideal opportunity to develop deep learning 
and automation alternatives to  promote autonomous functionality, increased safety solutions, 
improved resource management and maximized energy efficiency  in REAL WORLD 
ENVIRONMENTS .  
 
Connectivity must be secure, stable, and sufficient to support initial automation development 
phases.  A connected automation environment  will be established to  provide \ the necessary 
infrastructure to support different sensing technologies that can collect, store , and support 
transfer of data. Marysvill e/Port Huron will explore both theoretical and functional  
considerations of automation.  
 
One early functional automation approach will be developed to address challenges currently 
faced by tourists that are introduced to the Blue Water Convention Center, which lacks an 
effective shuttle option to transport touri sts/visitors to Downtown Port Huron. Current 
consideration is a Golf Cart Club Car that has autonomous capability previously used and 
developed on a college campus to act as a pilot shuttle program to allow tourist to select a 
destination of interest that they will be transported to as well as the option to define a pick up 
time that the shuttle will re turn to pick up the passenger and  return to the original point of 
departure. This case study scenario is also expected to provide further scenarios for addit ional on 
demand shuttle interfaces that will be supported through parallel developments of user 
applications  that could be used. It is an initial development program due to its primary 
dependency on Li Dar, which provides great development potential while i nfrastructure sensing is 
installed to increase its operational capability throughout the Smart City Project.  
 
There will also be  defined connected development zones are to support Autonomous Vehicle 
Development Testing for Tier 1 Automotive Suppliers and OEM’s. The opportunity to take 
advantage of a PUBLIC connected architecture and to progress through the diligent and 
demanding development requirements of the automotive industry will support real world testing 
of V2X  technologies and Big Data management into Validation phases. Many  automotive 
resources will be leveraged to maximize  infrastructure integrity within the Automation Alley 
metro Detroit region . Testing within the proposed development zones  provide opportunities for 
these companies to utilize Urb an, R ural, and Highway scenarios at  less risk than that of larger 
more congested cities to develop and test L1 -L4 Automation on Public Roads . This provides 
great opportunities to allow  companies to utilize the infrastructure openly and according to their 
schedules  and for the communities to gain value through data, exposure to the technology, and 
experience the future .  
 
A final example of Automation development involves a currently connected interstate highway 
corridor that is currently connected with V2X  infrastructure. There is opportunity to provide 
additional support from the Smart City Challenge  to ongoing development studies involving 
platooning activities on Class 8 Trucks. The current development model involves a driver -in-lead 
vehicle and a followi ng vehicle will operate in automated states to increase transport efficiency, 
energy conservation, safety  and utilization/operation factors.   
12 
  
“Cross -elemental” relationships of “Urban Automation ” exist in ALL of the other 11 elements to 
some extent. Suppl emental to the functional approaches to Urban Automation, theoretical 
activities will also be initiated to ensure the value of the data and the potential for contribution is 
maximized.  
 
Vision Element 2: Connected Vehicles  
From safety, cost, energy/ fuel conservation, advancement of technology, and t raffic efficiency to 
drivers who are informed of weather, road conditions,  construction, and emergencies.  
Connectivity provides many opportunities to improve on -road, roadside, and planning activities 
that are al l connected by the ability to collect, process, and manage big data. Using Dedicated 
Short Range Communication, Wi -Fi, and satellite connection s to connect vehicles to 
infrastructure, vehicles, and pedestrians to provide numerous  opportunities and expand e xisting 
developments from current  ongoing  Pilot Cities.  
 
Initial efforts to import elements of the progress of other Pilot Cities will be made to evaluate 
approaches to be taken to establish communication infrastructure to connect.  
 
Objectives of Connect ivity  
Infrastructure Solutions  – Network Requirement Analysis, Installation Procedures, Sensor 
Positioning Strategies, System Health Monitoring, as well as many other planned aspects of the 
installation, positioning, monitoring, and maintenance to the fou ndation of following Smart City 
Establishments . This will  utilize the funding to minimize the financial risks of other communities 
as they establish their configurations. The ability of this Smart City Collaboration to establish 
itself as a leader in the d iffusion across the country to other “Any Town USA” communities will 
depend on the competence of the infrastructure to support other municipalities and to function as 
a viable long term resource leveraging existing infrastructure and the lessons learned an d 
experiences.  
 
Technology Solutions  - Exploring different technology solutions at the infrastructure and vehicle 
levels will be among initial activities to support studies and deep learning that can be used to 
compare performance characteristics, limitat ions, quality, durability, and cost effectiveness 
comparisons. Consideration of acquisition, installation, maintenance, user reliability, processing, 
data handling, storage, and communication will be among other critical elements of evaluation.  
 
Developme nt Solutions  – Supporting connectivity users;  OEM, suppliers and software  and 
algorithm developers to take their developments further and extend the capabilities of this 
technology provide great opportunity to contribute in the GLOBAL arena of the transpor tation 
industries of automotive and commercial transit. Automated Driving Levels 1 -4 will have the 
ability to develop existing functionality, verify and validate functional safety analysis, explore 
HMI technologies at rates and use cases well beyond provin g ground and development facility 
capabilities. The ability of Port Huron and Marysville to support these development “partners” is 
believed to be offered in a more stable and controlled, although public, environment than larger 
cities to shorten the devel opment cycles for the users as well as provide the opportunity to 
explore connectivity variables and data at a much faster and broad rate.  
  
13 
 Data Use Case Studies  – Specific research opportunities of connected vehicle and infrastructure 
technology to model  and test traffic flow efficiency , safety improvements, homeland security 
improvements related to commercial freight and transport  crossing the Blue Water Bridge, 
providing additional mobility between downtown Port Huron and Convention Center, improving 
safety and efficiency of school buses in Marysville, and reducing congestion and  emissions from 
idling vehicles at known choke points (i.e. rail crossings, drawbridges, etc.)  
 Development/ Initiative targets to engage participating and developing  Tier 1 suppli ers, 
development partners  and OEM’s to support  development and use case studies that could 
mutually benefit their development as well as the evaluation of the data and the potential 
uses.  
 Technologies will integrate high -speed fiber networks, cellular infr astructure, Bluetooth 
beacons, GPS, and other technologies identified by project partners, OEM’s or the 
general public. The target will not only be to optimize the selection and identify selection 
criteria, but also to provide comparison data of different connectivity mediums that 
would be used for future reference and leverage further the following expertise:  
o Expertise in analysis and integration of V2X  (including vehicles, infrastructure) 
technologies  
o Expertise in security and scalability of wireless comm unication technologies 
including V2X , Wi-Fi, and cellular systems  
o Expertise in high -assurance system security architectures and secure software 
development.  
o Experience in specification, design, development, and NSA certification of secure 
micro digital da ta links which provides secure communications and 
interoperability among small ISR sensors, sensor platforms and remote surface 
terminals.  
 This system is the first of its type that is producible at low cost for 
widespread use. The over -the-air key managem ent allows designation of 
specific classes of ground terminals and users to receive and decrypt data.  
 Connected vehicles and appropriate information infrastructure could communicate and 
make pedestrians aware that vehicles ha ve detected their presence.  
 Development of User Models that demonstrate how different municipal sectors could 
benefit from available data sets to consider potential solutions for planned challenges of 
the future.  
 
Vision Element 3: Intelligent, Sensor -Based Infrastructure  
Intelligent, s ensor -based infrastructure will be deployed to collect data that will ultimately be 
used to improve system efficiencies, public safety, and overall mobility. Implications of sensor -
based infrastructure utilization include:  
 Blue Water Transit Buses – Schedu les and timing, vehicle location, passenger load 
information.  Blue Water Transit currently utilizes a Demand Response dispatch software 
program. It is not tied to automatic vehicle location (AVL) software. In fact, BWAT does 
not currently have any ITS fiel d equipment deployed.  
 Rail – train and crossings V2P  
 Auto mobile  – V2V, traffic light optimization, traffic load optimization  
 Truck/Freight – I-94/I-69 corridor Dynamic Message Services, ITS deployment in 
conjunction with existing MDOT Intelligent Transpor tation Systems.   
14 
  Maritime – Water traffic and conditions, boaters, paddlers, freighters. This data could 
assist first responders, law enforcement and homeland security/border patrol.  
 Blue Water Bridge – Traffic load, congestion/wait times, trucking utilizat ion, hazardous 
materials identification, border security  
 Drawbridges – Improve interface between boat and automobile traffic, congestion 
mitigation, system efficiencies.  
 Emergency Management – Police, Fire, Medical response, border patrol, hazardous 
materi als 
 St. Clair River – tourism updates, public information, outreach, resiliency, climate 
information  
 
Utilization of this Data will be focused on:  
 Video -based real -time analytics of activities of crowds (pedestrians, vulnerable road 
users) to support algo rithm development of desired use cases in above challenge 
scenarios.  
 Robust, embedded low -power sensor networks to support areas of Energy and Processing 
Optimization.  
 Customization of COTS technologies for monitoring traffic, pedestrians/bicyclists, and  
environmental variables.  
 Use case opportunities of low cost sensors for security, chemical and biological threat 
detection and how it can be shared with Emergency/Security Agencies (Police, Fire, 
Hospital, Border Patrol, Homeland Security, etc)  
 Developmen t and Research activities to investigate Internet of Things (IoT) theories and 
practices that improve the collection, processing and availability of the available data to 
support data user developments to support automation, vehicle performance, user 
interface, economical, environmental and developer interfaces that migrate to 
standardized interfaces for defined data sets.  
 
Vision Element 4: Urban Analytics  
Data collected from sensors will be analyzed by numerous stakeholder organizations (local, state, 
and federal) and will be collected and analyzed by the Michigan State University research team 
to identify advantages and contributions in knowledge transfer phase.  
 
The MSU team’s data analyses would include crossing qualitative and quantitative methods 
ranging from single case studies to big -data analysis.  Apart from expertise in the area of 
transport analytics, the project team would be able to garner support from MSU’s statistical and 
data analytics programs so as to suggest varied ways of collecting, an alyzing, storing and sharing 
data. This analytical capability will allow the project team to generate new insights on network 
efficiencies, safety and security, and travel patterns.  This will allow planners and public officials 
to have a better understandi ng of the impact of traffic from Canada, the impact of drawbridges 
on the transportation network, and the behavior of both drivers and transit riders.  
 
Additional data collected would be used by Land Information Access Association to help 
develop community  resiliency toolbox and community -wide adaptive capacity. In this sense, 
data collection and analysis would be focused on environmental impacts, climate change 
impacts, and how those factors affect coastal systems and people.   
15 
  
The City of Marysville curre ntly uses sensors for public safety/fire department uses in 
emergencies. Existing sensor deployment would be integrated with new technologies. All data 
derived from sensor deployment will be available to state and federal agencies so that they may 
measure,  test, evaluate, and implement additional innovation.  
 
Development of interfaces and user tools for complex multimodal systems customized for 
specific user groups to improve overall city efficiency will also be considered for execution of 
many of the devel opment projects considered.  
 
Vision Element 5: User -Focused Mobility Services and Choices  
The Port Huron/Marysville Smart Cities Collaborative is dedicated to improving mobility for all 
travelers, especially the aging population and persons with disabilit ies. Program partners will 
work with Blue Water Area Transit, the Council on Aging, and the developer community to 
create innovative solutions to providing shared -use mobility options, smart phone applications, 
bicycling, and other traveler -oriented strate gies. A long term vision is to develop a multi -
jurisdictional “Electric Avenue” along M -25 and M -29 in Port Huron and Marysville – corridor 
equipped with EV infrastructure for travelers.  Other opportunities to potentially work with 
students and developers on creating smart phone applications, mobility on demand services, and 
other tools will be explored.  
 
Vision Element 6: Urban Delivery and Logistics  
Port Huron and Marysville provide an ideal location with critical infrastructure to develop 
innovative solu tions supporting the efficient movement of freight through the use of deployed 
technologies.  This infrastructure starts with the Blue Water Bridge which spans the St. Clair 
River and carries international traffic between Port Huron, Michigan, and Point Edw ard and 
Sarnia, Ontario. Located near the I -94 and I -69 interchange, the bridge forms a critical gateway 
linking Canada and the United States.  Almost $70 billion of trade is completed via the Blue 
Water Bridge. It is the number one entry point for carriers  of hazardous, radioactive and 
flammable materials between St. Clair County and Ontario, Canada, and the number two entry 
for those same materials in the United States. Additionally, the St. Clair River International 
Railway Tunnel is 6,125 feet long and h as a diameter of 31 feet. The tunnel can accommodate 
double -stacked container trains, multi -level auto carriers and other large rail cars and payloads. 
The tunnel significantly reduces transit times for rail traffic that, in the past, had to be barged 
across the river, as well as for container traffic between Halifax and Chicago and the central U.S.  
 
Here the project team will with OEM’s and other partners to utilize robust, embedded low -power 
sensor networks, sensors for chemical and hazardous threat detec tion, and other V2X  
architectures to track logistics, cargo location, and route efficiencies.  
 
Vision Element 7: Strategic Business Models and Partnering  
The Port Huron/Marysville Smart Cities Collaborative will work with project partners to 
leverage crea tive partnerships that draw in additional stakeholders from the public, private, and 
non-profit sector.  Through its program management capacity, Ricardo Inc. will leverage strategic 
partnerships with OEM’s to maximize outputs through effective cost share m odels and co -
development.  Working with partner OEM’s and academic institutions will allow the team to  
16 
 overcome programmatic challenges through the utilization of best practices and the innovations 
being driven across sectors.  
 
The commitment of the Michiga n State University School of Planning, Design, and Construction 
will bring outstanding resources to the collaborative in terms of urban planning, civic 
engagement, data analytics, and knowledge transfer.  
 
Draper Labs, originally part of the Massachusetts I nstitute of Technology (MIT) and now a non -
profit company, has a rich history of ground -breaking research and game -changing technology 
innovation.  Draper has a s trong relationship with local universities  including MIT, Tufts, 
Harvard, B oston University,  and Northeastern . 
 Draper Lab Fellows (DLF) program brings in graduate students from local universities to 
work on projects that are of mutual interest to the student, the university faculty advisor, 
and to Draper.  
 Draper is a supporting member of MIT Energy Initiative’s study of ‘The Utility of the 
Future’  
 Relationships with subject matter experts concerning privacy for users in big data 
government projects  
 
There are also numerous opportunities for innovative new partnerships involving St. Clair 
County Commu nity College and the St. Clair County Regional Educational Services Agency for 
academic programming focused on smart infrastructure development, advanced mechatronics, 
and engineering solutions.  
 
Projects implemented through the Smart City Challenge have a n immediate connection to the 
various homeland security initiatives underway in St. Clair County – a federally -designated 
Virtual City pilot site.  The implications for innovation and big data analytics to benefit state and 
federal agencies, including MDOT,  Customs and Border Patrol, and the Department of 
Homeland Security provide additional partnership opportunities.  
 
Vision Element 8: Smart Grid, Roadway Electrification, and Electric Vehicles  
As a Smart City Challenge finalist, Port Huron and Marysville wo uld work to develop a plan for 
the creation of an “Electric Avenue” along the M -25//M -29 corridor that connects both cities. 
The vision for the Port Huron/Marysville  “Electric Avenue” would be to equip the corridor with 
electric vehicle charging infrastruc ture that leverages the smart grid. Developing this corridor as 
an EV -friendly destination will provide needed infrastructure and resources to drivers of electric 
vehicles  coming into the country or leaving the cou ntry via the Blue Water Bridge, as well as  our 
residents who already have or are considering an electric vehicle. Moreover, this would create 
additional economic development opportunities for both communities  
 
The project team will leverage experience in the optimization of distributed assets acro ss a 
network with high levels of uncertainty. Experience in this kind of critical analysis has been 
executed to previously develop architecture for a demonstration of parked electric vehicles as 
grid-connected storage that incorporates incentives for vehic le owners to connect in the 
instrumented demonstration area. The objective would be to take initial steps to realize this 
vision to expand and increase capability.   
17 
  
Potential partners to engage at different stages will be leveraged to manage the tangible outputs 
as well as the knowledge potential with great consideration of the financial investments required. 
The objective would be to make as much transportation and energy information available for 
“deep learning” to realistically support as many industria l applications that initial plan execution 
would be capable.  
 
Vision Element 9: Connected, Involved Citizens  
An essential part of planning is public engagement and meaningful public participation. 
Researchers from Michigan State University will lend expert ise in multiple ways to get the 
public involved and make them informed, well -connected and smart citizens.  Keeping the public 
informed and connected will help in moving the demonstration forward, while creating an 
environment where civic entrepreneurship a nd innovation is fostered and fueled.  Informed 
citizens will be more open to engage in connectedness and use the data in creative ways to 
address transportation challenges. This push towards civic engagement would move towards an 
open governance platform, through which smart cities communicate.  
 
Planning interventions are most successful if they have buy -in from the residents and the local 
business community. As part of our planning efforts, MSU will survey the local population and 
local businesses about th eir visions, desires, and expectations of a Smart City. This survey will 
be tailored to answer to the 12 vision elements of the USDOT priority areas. With the results of 
this survey pilot, we are informing the full proposal and are also demonstrating the a pplication of 
multiple vision areas.  
 
Making the connected data open is critical to maximizing the realization of the potential that will 
invite and welcome software engineers and app developers to innovate the defined Smart City 
projects. The objective wi ll be to open up development dialogue to widen the brainstorming 
between citizens and businesses how data can be used to improve their operation and functions.  
 
The resulting developments will also be tracked and monitored for analysis. The team will 
exami ne how  these developments contribute to improving speed, efficiency, and engagement 
that can be used directly to address growth and utilization challenges that communities are 
expected to face in the future.  Additional efforts to fully utilize crowdsourcin g, social media, and 
other forms of public input will be explored.  
 
Additionally, we will monitor municipal performance and feedback that can be incorporated into 
each separate project.  The cities will also utilize their official websites to share open dat a and 
promote open government.  We will create citizen forums to communicate concerns or areas of 
improvement that captured items can be taken to tech forums for consideration of alternative 
methods of engagement through technology and software solutions th at can be presented and 
demonstrated to the citizens for evaluation. Project partners will also host ‘hackathons’ to invite 
citizens, businesses, developers and coders to work on creating solutions that stabilize and build 
cyber -security/functional safety into the developing systems as early as possible.

 Vision Element 10: Architecture and Standards  
With the support of multiple engineering and software development companies, there is a broad 
background and expertise in systems engineering, modeling and s imulation. There is great 
leadership capability to lead systems development efforts that combine the latest research in 
physics, electronics, micro -mechanical devices, computer and packaging technologies, and 
software engineering to provide system solution s in diverse domains.  
 
Conceptualization of new architectures for complex systems, namely systems driven jointly by 
people and data and physics will be leveraged to advance modeling and simulation to understand 
the uncertainties at these boundaries.  
 
With deep pools of experience in defining development architecture, Partners have been sought 
to support the goal to leverage the developments of this initiative to support ongoing studies and 
alignment requirement of existing and developing specifications an d standards to support the 
progress, development, and realization of the envisioned CVRIA/National ITS Architecture in 
accordance to ITS standards.  
 
Vision Element 11: Low -Cost, Efficient, Secure, and Resilient Information and 
Communications Technology (I CT) 
ICT activities will be managed with the utmost respect to privacy and security practices. This 
will be considered and weighed heavily in Infrastructure Component and Architecture choices. 
ICT Project activities will be conducted in parallel to those co ntained in Vision Element #10.  
 
The initial collection of data will be limited to specified development needs and system 
verification. Parallel activity will be managed to monitor the data to ensure that there is no risk or 
intrusion of Personal Identifia ble Information.  
 
A key element of the Project Management Activities must be an understanding of the data being 
collected and understanding how it is being used in functional developments. Theoretical 
Research Studies provide much greater latitude to expl ore alternative data uses, but components 
of these studies will also be to ensure Privacy is not violated or data compromised.  
 
“Hackathons” have been mentioned as important activities within Element #9, however the 
challenges posed to compromise the infr astructure and the ability to improve the security of the 
cyber environment is viewed as critical and a very valuable activity to provide information that 
can be provided and transferred well beyond this initiative for other Big Data Considerations.  
 
The Wi-Fi Alliance has introduced Wi -Fi HaLow as the designation for products incorporating 
IEEE 802.11ah technology. Wi -Fi HaLow operates in frequency bands below one gigahertz, 
offering longer range, lower power connectivity to Wi -Fi certified products. Wi -Fi HaLow will 
enable a variety of new power -efficient use cases in the connected vehicle, the smart home, and 
digital healthcare, as well as industrial, retail, agriculture, and Smart City environments.  
 
The establishment of a Wi -Fi HaLow network could ena ble Port Huron and Marysville to be 
pilot locations for Google's Project ARA, which is a low -cost modular technology platform.  A 
module that connects an ARA device to the Wi -Fi HaLow network could enable a public  
19 
 intranet, allowing users to engage city ser vices/systems without cost. Using ARA, a person could 
summon cars, connect with local businesses, check bus schedules, provide feedback to public 
officials, and utilize other messaging features. In short, it could connect citizens to crucial 
community syst ems. 
 
A multi -partner approach will be taken to increase development participation and minimize risk 
and comply with any and all auditing requirements. Development Integrity Verification activities 
will be held regularly and randomly to ensure that develop ments are protected from Tampering.  
 
Consideration of defensive approaches to prevent tampering or manipulation with any of the 
signals or infrastructure will be made and part of each project development activity as well as an 
offensive approach to implem ent integrity checks to ensure high signal confidence is maintained 
and made available to development partners. Security measures will be developed and 
maintained accordingly.  
 
Vision Element 12: Smart Land Use  
The cities of Port Huron and Marysville have managed growth and development through smart, 
comprehensive planning over the span of many decades. While Port Huron is an urban 
community and Marysville is more of a suburban enclave, both c ities have planned and utilized 
their land, their natural resourc es, and their infrastructure in order to optimize efficiencies and 
provide a high quality of life for residents.  
 
Port Huron is the county seat of St. Clair County. An urban community with higher density 
development, a central business district, and a rob ust public transit system, the city exhibits 
many of the tenets of Smart Growth.  While Marysville is more suburban in nature, its 
neighborhoods are generally developed in traditional neighborhood design with a grid street 
network. While not a CBD like in P ort Huron, the Gratiot corridor that cuts through the city from 
east to west from I -94 to the St. Clair River provides a mix of commercial, office, and service 
uses for the residential neighborhoods and industrial areas that surround it.  
 
In both communiti es, citizens have access to employment centers, a range of affordable housing 
options and housing types, health services, neighborhood schools and parks, and non -motorized 
facilities such as the Bridge to Bay Trail and other sidewalks and paths. Port Huron ’s downtown 
core is highly walkable and public transit is readily accessible through the Blue Water Area 
Transit Hub that is located right in the heart of the downtown.  Together, Port Huron and 
Marysville are neighboring communities that complement each ot her and combine to form the 
perfect test lab for connected and autonomous vehicle and infrastructure deployment and testing.  
 
The City of Port Huron Master Plan  is based on the following foundations and goals:  
 
Land Use and Neighborhoods:  
 Create a balance d land use pattern that offers a mixture of uses in an organized, 
compatible manner.  
 Support Port Huron as a thriving urban core for St. Clair County.  
 Continue a strong residential presence and offer unified, traditional, and livable 
neighborhoods.   
20 
  Support  development of neighborhoods and housing compatible with existing character.  
 
Commercial Districts and Economic Development:  
 Offer a unified system of distinct commercial business nodes.  
 Ensure commercial development will promote the city’s character.  
 Encourage an active, successful downtown that is walkable and livable.  
 Increase the desirability of the city for economic development.  
 Continue efforts to retain existing businesses.  
 Support a strong industrial development presence.  
 Strengthen the city’s appe al for tourism.  
 Attract and retain the younger population to live and work in Port Huron.  
 Create new entrepreneurial opportunities and resources.  
 
Transportation and Community Facilities:  
 Offer a vehicular transportation system that is integrated with the city’s character.  
 Integrate a non -motorized pathway and greenway system throughout the city.  
 Unify the multiple modes of transportation and offer safe and enjoyable circulation 
options.  
 Offer high -quality and efficient public services to residents and the region.  
 Increase the desirability of the city for new residents and businesses.  
 Expand and diversify the city’s park and recreation system.  
 Provide a unified open space system throughout the city.  
 
The City of Marysville Master Plan  includes the following goals related to land use and 
development:  
 
Residential Area Goals:  
 Provide sidewalks where recommended by the City’s adopted Walkable Community 
Plan.  
 Promote the construction of housing that appeal to a wide range of tastes and meets the 
needs of all City  residents.  
 Encourage cluster housing arrangements that preserve open space and natural features 
without compromising the quality of housing.  
 Work to provide an integrated path system through developing areas of the City as 
proposed in the City’s Walkable Community Plan . 
 Create a fund for the purchase and assembly of land to provide land configured in a way 
that will allow for high quality development. This will also allow the City to specify how 
the land will be developed.  
 Require the creation of stub stre ets within proposed subdivisions to allow for the 
interconnection of different neighborhoods as they develop.  
 Require new developments to connect to existing stub streets.  
 
Commercial and Office Area Goals:  
 To create a healthy business environment with a b road range of uses to account for the 
needs of Marysville residents while assuring compatible land use relationships.   
21 
  To create small nodes of commercial facilities that cater to the convenience needs of 
Marysville residents, on a neighborhood level.  
 Promo te zoning that provides for compact clustering of convenience -oriented uses.  
 
Industrial Area Goals:  
 Utilize zoning, which is designed to attract new, high technology, and low intensity 
Industrial uses.  
 Provide for circulation systems that assure adequate access to emergency vehicles.  
 Attempt to cluster uses with similar needs and intensities.  
 
6) Technical, Policy, and Institutional Risks and Mitigation  
 
Self driving cars on public roads, development -level transportation activities, public risk 
considerati on, functional safety unknowns,  technology awareness and learning, and public 
awareness are just some of the risks that must be considered during project plan execution.  
 
The platform of the Port Huron/Marysville submission is PUBLIC project execution. Thi s will 
require transparency, communication, diligence, and assumption of individual responsibility to 
the public on behalf of all Smart City partners.  
 
Legal considerations will be made and implemented within the project plan. Educational 
institutions will  support public engagement exercises to implement communication strategies. 
Regular project meetings will be held face -to-face and in virtual environments to ensure open 
communication is made to project partners regarding technical status bulletins and use r activity 
planning.  
 
From a public oversight standpoint, St. Clair County would explore the creation of a regional 
Smart City management office to monitor project activity, coordinate communications, and 
facilitate further planning.

Project partners will continue to engage with multiple OEM’s, academic institutions, and other 
organizations that may take an interest in participating in the demonstration projects. 
Additionally, partners will work through USDOT to engage oth er Smart Cities  to share 
experiences and maximize development potential.  Our focus is to create a Smart City 
environment that will engage OEM’s and suppliers to drive innovation and support 
developmental progress  that parallels USDOT’s vision of an ideal S mart City model.  
 
8) Existing Transportation Infrastructure  
 
Arterial Miles  
The City of Marysville has 13 miles of arterial roads. The City of Port Huron has 10 miles of 
state ‘M’ routes, 40 miles of major arterials, and 90 miles of local streets.  
 
Transit  Services  
Public transportation has been a critical part of the City of Port Huron and surrounding 
communities since 1866. Beginning in the 1880's, Port Huron was one of the first communities 
to operate an electric transit system, and during the 1930's, wa s one of the first communities to 
operate motor coaches. With the exception of a brief period from 1968 to 1976, Port Huron has 
operated some form of public transportation for over 135 years. Since 1976, BWATC has 
continued this tradition by carrying over 15 million passengers in its nearly 70 square mile 
service area. In 1996, BWATC began operating compressed natural gas (CNG) buses.  
 
BWATC’s current fleet consists of 86 buses – all fueled by Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). 
They also operate the largest CNG fueling station in the State of Michigan and three refueling 
stations located throughout St. Clair County.  
 
BWATC currently operates seven  regularly scheduled bus routes and a shopper shuttle within 
the City of Port Huron and Fort Gratiot Township. Althoug h there are fixed stops along each 
route, the service operates a flag system where necessary to allow bus riders to catch the bus 
anywhere along route. Headways are generally 45 minutes and all vehicles for the fixed route 
service are lift or ramp -equipped  and are equipped with bicycle racks.  On-demand services are 
available for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) eligible riders, as well as limited mobility 
passengers. All vehicles available for this service are lift -equipped.  
 
Demand response, or Dial -A-Ride,  services are available Monday -Saturday to residents living in 
Burtchville, Port Huron, and Fort Gratiot townships and Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in the 
City of Marysville. During the summer tourist season, BWATC operates a trolley route that 
highlights the historic and scenic sites of the downtown area. The route lasts approximately an 
hour and includes several points of interest, historic sites and panoramic views of the Blue Water 
Bridge and the St. Clair River.  
 
A commuter service runs to Ches terfield Township, a community in northern Macomb County 
that is home to many suburban office parks, twice a day Monday through Friday. This service 
also links up with the Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART) buses 
so commuters c an make a connection to their final destination in Southeast Michigan and/or  
23 
 downtown Detroit. This route is called the I -94 Express Route. It has four stops in St. Clair 
County before reaching its final destination at 23 Mile Road and Gratiot Avenue. Comm uters 
can also take the M -29 Route that will take riders to New Baltimore in Macomb County.  
 
BWATC held a Grand Opening celebration for the new transfer hub on December 11, 2015. The 
new transfer hub is designed to improve the process of boarding buses dow ntown to travel along 
seven routes throughout Port Huron and the surrounding communities.  
 
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)  
The Southeast Michigan Transportation Operations Center (SEMTOC) is the hub of ITS 
technology applications at the Michigan Department of Transportation  (MDOT), which h as 
significant ITS infrastructure on the freeways around Port Huron and Marysville and leading up 
to the Blue Water Bridge . The MI Drive website ( www.michigan.gov/drive ) is the direct link 
between SEMTOC and the public. The site is updated in real time with closed circuit TV 
cameras, dynamic message signs, and Microwave Vehicle Detection Sensors in conjunction with 
Probe Traffic Detectors. This includes areas along I -94 leading to Marysville, Port Huron, and 
the Blue Water Bridge.  
 
Additionally, the traffic signals within the Port Huron/Marysville area on MDOT roadways (M -
25, M -29) have a variety of detection systems currently installed.  MDOT generally uses two 
types of s ignal controllers: pre -timed and traffic actuated. The pre -timed system operates under a 
predetermined schedule or clock that is programmed ahead of time and controls the cycle length.   
 
The traffic actuated version is more modern and relies on vehicle det ection devices to allow the 
signal to self -adjust. These devices range from detection loops in the pavement that use changes 
in magnetic fields to trigger the sensors, to video detections t hat use pixilation, microwave or 
infrared variations to pick up mov ement.  
 
9) Current Data Collection and Analysis  
 
Current data collection in Marysville and Port Huron includes  this includes data relating to urban 
planning, land use, building use, assets, transport and various local government services.  The 
communities c ollect and track demographic, economic, and property information from sources 
such as the U.S. Census Bureau, the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG), 
ESRI, St. Clair County, Michigan Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development. Additionally, both cities engage in ongoing traffic counts, 
pavement surface evaluation, and utility utilization.  
 
A great amount of data is shared among communities and with St. Clair County entities. St. Clair 
County has be en designated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as a regional pilot 
site for “Virtual City”  operational technology evaluations, policies, and standards development 
with an initial focus on geospatially -enabled collaboration tools for all -hazards and daily 
decision support.  
 
The St. Clair County pilot intends to demonstrate a single picture to view multiple sources of 
information related to the security of city and county infrastructure and assets, along with other  
24 
 data. Templates will be created t o allow for reuse and standards development related to common 
external feeds, connectors, and screen elements for future use in other sites across the nation. 
Browser accessible, map -based common operating pictures will be deployed to assist first 
responde rs with their mission.  
 
Under the Smart City Challenge, the deployment of smart, sensor -based infrastructure could 
strengthen the implementation of the Virtual City pilot, bringing new data into operations.  
Overall, the Virtual City project provides a way  for law enforcement, emergency response 
agencies, and key community leaders on both sides of the border to easily share and access 
information. The project software, called the Blue Water Area RESILIENT (Regional 
Interoperability Collaboration Network), i s an inter -agency portal that consolidates critical 
emergency management data from many sources in a shared web -based interface. Four Michigan 
counties, the Michigan State Police, and Lambton, County Ontario are participating in the 
program, which was init iated under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security’s 
Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate.  
 
Using RESILIENT, participating agencies are sharing:  
 Incident reports and crime data from 911 systems  
 Real-time webcam feeds  
 Locations and contact data for first responders  
 Regionally available resources (hazmat teams, bomb squads, K -9 units)  
 Data on potentially vulnerable infrastructure (hospitals, schools, power plants)  
 SARA Title III worst -case and most probable release scenarios  
 School and other building floor plans, including 360 degree virtual walk through pictures  
 
Existing data frameworks and potential new data that can be collected through sensor -based 
infrastructure and V2X  technologies will create entirely new sets of Big Data. Through data  
sharing agreements and appropriate public policy, project partners will work with other 
stakeholders to organize and analyze these new datasets to glean new insights for enhancing the 
transportation network, improving livability, strengthening community r esiliency, and mitigating 
climate change impacts.  
 
10) Standards, Architectures, and Certification Processes  
 
Port Huron and Marysville will work with public and private sector organizations to ensure 
existing standards, architectures, and certification pr ocesses for intelligent transportation systems 
and connected vehicle based technologies are utilized. We will also work with other U.S. and 
global cities to develop a common platform to establish a market for developers to open 
discussions that could allow  projects to contribute to potential unique challenges outside the 
scope of the Port Huron/Marysville Smart Cities Collaborative.  
 
The overall aim of the Smart Cities Collaborative is to achieve more interoperability, scalability, 
reusability, platform ind ependence and thus to reduce costs and risks by use of these 
applications.  Working with Michigan State University’s School of Planning, Design, and 
Construction, the team will ensure that these data standards and processes, along with lessons 
learned, are fully documented and included in the knowledge transfer phase.   
25 
  
We are cognizant of USDOT’s participation in the ITS Standards and Architecture 
Harmonization program and activities focusing on the standards needed to provide connectivity 
among vehicles, an d between vehicles and infrastructure.  Harmonization facilitates 
interoperability among products and systems, which benefits transportation management 
agencies, vehicle manufacturers, equipment vendors, and other stakeholders. By overcoming 
institutional a nd financial barriers to technology harmonization, stakeholders could realize lower 
life-cycle costs for the acquisition and maintenance of systems.  
 
The project team will stay abreast of efforts within the international standards community to 
harmonize st andards and architecture in order to increase vehicle connectivity.   
 
11) Goals and Objectives  
 
Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, once said ""the possibilities for how 
cities can use that data to improve lives – and improve the way servi ces are provided to citizens 
– are limitless.""  The vision of the Port Huron/Marysville Smart Cities Collaborative is detailed 
above on page 2 of this application narrative.  The common denominator in all of the strategic 
actions and implementation measures that can help project partners and stakeholders achieve that 
vision is Big Data.  Data can be used as an essential service that provides better inputs affecting 
the way we live and work.  Smart cities will figure out optimal methods of collecting data, 
analy zing that data, and connecting that data to make impactful changes in the community.  
 
In order to evaluate our success in moving toward and ultimately achieving our vision, the Port 
Huron/Marysville Smart Cities Collaborative has the following goals and ob jectives:  
 
Goal 1: Advance Open Government and Open Data  
 Objective 1: Treat data as a public utility, such as water, power, gas and transportation.  
 Objective 2:  Identify innovative ways to analyze and use big data.  
 
Goal 2: Improve safety  
 Objective 1:  Use connected vehicle technologies and other smart infrastructure to reduce 
traffic crashes, injuries, and fatalities.  
 Objective 2: Utilize smart infrastructure solutions to enhance homeland security and

emerging mobility services to improve personal mobility for citizens.  
 Objective 3 : Provide a real -world community setting for OEM’s, software developers, 
application developers, academics, and other stakeholders to test, model, and refine 
autonomous and connected vehicles.  
 
 
  
26 
 Goal 4: Mitigate Climate Change Impacts  
 Objective 1:  Utiliz e smart infrastructure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, traffic 
congestion, and other community systems that may negatively impact air and water 
quality or threaten sustainability.  
 Objective 2: Develop the adaptive capacity of local governments and citi zens in 
becoming more resilient to economic and environmental disruptions.  
 
Goal 5: Educate and engage citizens about Smart City initiatives  
 Objective 1:  Survey citizens in Port Huron and Marysville to get their thoughts, ideas, 
and concerns about what a S mart City means to them.  
 Objective 2:  Educate citizens on the benefits of connected and autonomous vehicles, 
electric vehicles, open government and human -machine interaction.  
 Objective 3: Increase opportunities for crowdsourcing and social media utilizatio n to 
generate community knowledge, innovation, and increase access.  
 
Goal 6: Facilitate knowledge transfer and replication in other communities  
 Objective 1: Develop Smart City Roadmap that other cities can use to plan and 
implement Smart City initiatives.  
 Objective  2: Share experiences with academia and OEM’s through presentations, 
conferences, and information exchanges.  
 Objective 3: Develop a Resilient Communities toolbox that integrates Smart City 
adaptations, ideas for mitigating climate change, and enha ncing livability.  
 
The Port Huron/Marysville Collaborative will continually monitor the impacts of the 
demonstration projects to assess progress and understand how mobility, safety, efficiency, 
sustainability, and climate change are being affected.  Metrics , milestones, and deliverables will 
be formalized in the phase 2 project plan.  Ongoing documentation with project partners will be 
translated in the final knowledge transfer phase.  
 
12) Capacity for Implementation and Performance Management  
 
The cities of Port Huron and Marysville have a long history of managing and implementing state 
and federal grant programs. Additionally, a great spirit of cooperation exists between these two 
cities, neighboring communities, and St. Clair County.  
 
The Port Huron/Marysvi lle Smart Cities Collaborative will manage overall grant activities with 
the assistance of its quality partnerships.  These partnerships include world class systems 
engineering firms such as Ricardo and Draper Laboratories , a strong connection to higher 
education from the community college level to world class universities, participation from 
elemental -specific experts well -versed in the latest smart infrastructure innovations, and lean and 
responsive local governments.  
 
13) Cost Share, In -Kind Donations, an d Partnering  
 
Proximity to the “Hub” of the automotive industry in the Metro Detroit area and to most all of 
the top Tier 1 global automotive suppliers provides incredible opportunity to establish co - 
27 
 development activities in any and all of the 12 elements  in areas that will produce results and 
reports that will reach well beyond the seven  selected use case challenges of the municipalities.  
 
Consideration of the submitted vision proposal has been based on primarily the USDOT portion 
of the Grant Funding al one. Although the Vulcan portion of available funding opportunity is also 
sought, the goal was to ensure that this vision could be funded with as minimal funding and as 
maximum co -development as possible to progress connectivity technology and data process ing 
learning and realization to develop experience, expertise, and validation supporting concepts and 
theories that will support evolution of this technology and its capability to contribute to making it 
easier to face the challenges of the future related to mobility and population trends.  
 
Partnerships with world class engineering solution institutions, Ricardo and Draper Laboratories, 
along with potential collaboration and co -development opportunities with global Tier 1 supplier 
and safety leader Autoliv  ASP Research and Development are believed to provide consideration 
for addressing developments that will provi de significantly favorable cost/ value considerations.  
 
Furthermore, to leverage educational institutions from community college to world class 
universities, significant opportunity to explore more theoretical initial aspects are believed to 
provide greater development and results and value.

The Smart City  
Comes Into View
Smart Seattle —  12017 wasn’t the first time Seattle reinvented 
itself. It had been a perennial occurrence 
since its birth in the 1850s, a boomtown that faded but somehow always boomed again. In 2015 the city was becoming a victim of its own success. It had recently been named the fastest-growing major city in the US, and its economic growth was explosive. But traffic congestion, which also ranked amongst the country’s worst each year, was strangling some of the city’s most vital employment centers. To its critics, the fate seemed inescapable. Growth equals congestion, period. The region was moving toward all-day gridlock. Crashes and other unexpected events could commonly send the entire network into crisis. 
By 2017, after wining the Smart Cities Challenge, 
the city started to feel distinctly different. It faced the same challenges of course, but with a new adaptiveness and resiliency. The first changes were subtle. Transit riders, who had become accustomed to being passed up by full buses, noted that they weren’t shut out quite as often. New car sharing services were spotted downtown, most of them piloting electric cars. 
The tipping point became evident early in 2018, 
when a “perfect storm” threatened to send the transportation system into an all-night lockdown: a Monday night football game, a multi-car crash on I-5, and construction work on one of the freeway’s best-known alternate routes. The lucky ones, who were already home in front of their TVs by 5:00, tuned in to watch the drama. They knew very well what these events always did to Seattle traffic. But in 2018 the crisis never happened... Sluggish, but very much alive, the network healed itself quicker than even imagined. By 8:15 normal operations had resumed. For most of the weary commuters, re-heated suppers were now their greatest concern. 
The city was abuzz the next week – but the real 
transformation, based on millions of small and nearly invisible decisions, was just beginning. A software engineer relocated to Seattle and planned to buy a car after getting settled, but he never got around to it. A downtown office worker began flexing her schedule 20 minutes each day, and regained several wasted hours of commute time each week. A swing-shift warehouse worker started taking safer, more convenient rides home in a car share vehicle instead of driving alone. Deliveries were ordered and scheduled to take advantage of open load zones, and additional TNC vehicles were dispatched to meet each day’s travel demand – wherever that demand occurred. “Mobility as a service” flourished far more in Seattle than anywhere else in the nation. By 2020, there was no doubt that something revolutionary had happened here. 
Seattle had chartered a different course from 
other cities in very fundamental ways. The city had the highest adoption rates for electric vehicles in the country, simply because most vehicles were being sold to companies that offered mobility as a service. There was no doubt that this city had become smart, but it hadn’t happened by an engineering or computing breakthrough inside a government office. Instead the city had simply enabled the collective power of millions of smart decisions – in real time – made by the same citizens, taxpayers, and companies who were depending on the outcomes for their everyday lives.“Hi Don. Your son Adam was 
just registered in a $25,000 lottery 
for downloading a new app. He suggested that you might be interested too. It’s a free download that helps you get around Seattle, and saves you time and money as you go! No commitment, just click here if you want to try it out and 
enter the lottery.”
“Evie, it’s Dr. Einstein. Hate to brag, 
but I’ve saved you a bunch of time and money lately: You’ve saved $22  since I started riding with you, plus almost 3 hours! Click here to see more. Plus I know who’s been saving even more than you, and I’ve even got tips on how they did it. Actually the top 5 are each winning $1,000. Want 
to see if you’re close?”
“Hey Logan, me again. I’m Tyrion, 
your travel concierge. Heads up dude! You’re waiting for a bus on Madison, right? They’re all packed, big Seahawks game. Take Uber instead. It costs $2.73 more, but I’ll pay this time. Click here. I’ll credit your account when you get your ride. Save you about 37 minutes tonight!”
“Vivian , quick tip. Either work 
another 30 minutes tonight or take the 550 bus, OK? 565 is standing-room only. Click here if you want another update in 25 minutes.”
2 — Smart SeattleVision
The Seattle Department of Transportation, with 
an elite team of partners from the University of Washington, Microsoft, and King County Metro, will create an unprecedented urban “Mobility Marketplace”: a powerful data platform that consolidates and optimizes all transportation modes in a single environment.  The Mobility Marketplace:Q1: Vision  
Define your vision for your Smart City.by employing incentives that influence behavior, and thus distribute loads to various modes over time. The Mobility Marketplace is made possible by an expansive system collecting and sharing data – safely, securely, and efficiently – to participating entities and the public at large. 
The project delivers the following:
1. Data Collection – The City, King County 
Metro, and other partners will install 
sensors and communication systems 
to collect real-time data about the transportation ecosystem.   Technology 
will be installed on fixed and mobile assets 
– both publicly and privately owned – including buses and light rail trains, traffic 
signals, electric charging stations, parking 
spaces, street lights, and shared vehicles. This will revolutionize the City’s ability to 
achieve a truly comprehensive, real-time 
knowledge of the entire transportation ecosystem
2. Data Platform – The City and its partners will create a sophisticated data and 
communications platform to process, 
manage, and distribute the collected data.  The platform first protects and encrypts 
all sensitive data in adherence to federal 
and state policy. Second, it provides access to the data, as appropriate, to 
government agencies, private corporations, 
and individual travelers. Finally, it packages and distributes the data in ways 
that will optimize its usefulness for all 
audiences: professional and citizen alike.  A disinterested third party will host the 
platform through a “data collaborative” and 
will be responsible for the management, distribution, and security of the data and 
assets.   
3. The Mobility MarketPlace – Like 
many modern platforms, the Mobility 
MarketPlace equips all transportation 
providers with a place to securely distribute their apps, data, or services to 
users. However, the Mobility MarketPlace 
adds several critical levels that passive trip planning apps do not approach: 
Across all  
travel modes
Using powerful 
incentives
Optimizes capacity, 
user experience, and 
societal good
Connecting the public 
and private sectors
And a single payment 
gateway
Through the Mobility Marketplace, users of 
all income levels will be able to identify the fastest and most affordable way to get to their destination in that particular moment, using the optimal combination of public and private transportation modes. Payment for their trip is completed with a simple swipe of a smart phone.  The City will be able to manage and influence the distribution of people and goods across all modes 
* USDOT funds will not pay for any incentives. USDOT’s Smart City Challenge grants will be used to install data collection equipment, and to 
develop and manage the data collaborative and Mobility MarketPlace. On-going traveler incentives may be funded through a combination of corporate sponsorships, subscriptions to the data collaborative, and negotiated fees for customers referred to private transportation providers.
Question 1 — Smart Seattle —  3Unique Proposition Addresses User Needs Advances USDOT Interests
• Leverages the collective power 
of millions of optimized trips to optimize an entire multi-modal network
• Creates user-based incentives to synchronize smart travel behavior that achieves positive societal impacts
• Builds the Mobility MarketPlace – an open-source data platform – and allows the private sector to grow the concept
• Revolutionizes the ability to ingest data, providing real-time and historical knowledge of the transportation ecosystem• Provides a personalized travel 
concierge
• Actively pushes comparative travel options info and offers to a person’s smart phone
• Addresses the needs of all system users, including for low-income and unbanked people and for goods movement
•  Offers ease of payment for all 
services (public and private) through a single payment gateway 
•  Reduces transportation costs 
by enabling car-free/car-lite living• Optimizes systems in real time across all modes without building costly infrastructure
• Spurs innovation and creates an incubator for the best technology breakthroughs to quickly advance to market
• Changes fundamental market economics to d rive electric 
vehicle and automated vehicle adoption rates
• Tests the Data Collaborative model to acquire, manage, secure, and distribute data and assetspushing timely information to the user, 
incentivizing*  behavior, and providing a 
seamless, multimodal payment mechanism. 
It is also through this marketplace that existing services, like Bing and Google Maps, 
will be able to subscribe to government or 
third-party data. Subscriptions will allow them to integrate mobility information with 
their maps and their navigation offerings 
through APIs. The consolidated distribution of multi-party data will energize a host of 
new services delivered by the private sector, 
both from large enterprises as well as the entrepreneurial and NGO communities.  
4. Service Optimization – The Data Collaborative also provides critical data 
for transportation service providers and 
system operators to optimize their services.  For example, as travel behavior changes 
in response to the Mobility MarketPlace, 
the City can immediately determine which traffic signals need to be retimed - and 
accomplish that retiming without collecting 
additional data.  As the city grows, transit agencies can add or modify routes based 
directly on where people and goods are 
traveling.  In a virtuous cycle, optimizing transportation services improves travel 
options and lowers the per-trip cost for all 
travelers.
— Question 1Why Seattle
The City of Seattle is an environment where 
innovation naturally lives and thrives. The City of Seattle and its partners have developed one of the nation’s most aggressive climate action plans – and with its tech-savvy population, and the pioneering spirit of its business community, Seattle has consistently been on the forefront of new transportation technology. Electric and autonomous vehicles are not a speculative planning effort here; they are reality. The current question for Seattle, and the upcoming question for all US cities, is how we will adapt: how we continuously bolster the success of the market’s best new innovations, influence their adoption rates, and ensure that they are advancements for societal good as well as individual good. Seattle is, in many ways, uniquely prepared to take on the Smart City Challenge.
4 — Smart SeattleAddressing Challenges
The project directly addresses Seattle’s pressing transportation-related challenges as follows: 
Description Response
Insufficient Capacity
Seattle was the fastest-growing large city in the country 
in 2014 and continues its rapid growth*. This growth, coupled with a historic underinvestment in public transportation and lack of a subway system, is straining the transportation system, creating capacity challenges. This project “increases” capacity by optimizing the existing systems instead of building costly physical infrastructure, like roads, or purchasing more equipment, such as buses or trains.
Fractured Transportation System
Seattle’s current array of transportation providers includes three public transit agencies (King County Metro, Sound Transit, and the City of Seattle), private micro-transit and car share providers, transportation network companies (TNCs), taxis, vanpools, and for-hire vehicles. To the user, the system is fractured. Out of habit or for lack of information, residents regularly default to suboptimal trip choices.This project enables informed and efficient decision-making by providing users with real-time information, incentives, and streamlined payments for all plausible trip options and mode combinations. In turn, the data available on user choice enables transportation agencies and firms to more effectively couple supply to this demand.
Constrained Freight Mobility
Population growth, plus the trend towards e-commerce, has led to tremendous growth in goods delivery throughout an already freight-heavy city. Seattle is home to the Port of Seattle, including North Harbor of the Northwest Seaport Alliance (NWSA), which operates the third-largest container load center in the US. It is becoming increasingly challenging to complete trips, particularly “last mile” deliveries.The Mobility MarketPlace has myriad ways to address freight challenges. In making public and private data available, the system facilitates “object pooling.” For example, UBER can deliver both a passenger and an unrelated box in a single trip. As desired, the City may choose to use connected vehicle technology to further incentivize object pooling by allowing participating “Freight and Transit” vehicles in the carpool lanes to optimize available system capacity. Coordination and cooperation with the NWSA will increase visibility, and reduce the occurrence and length of drayage truck queues at container terminals in the Seattle Harbor.
Equity
The rapidly increasing price of housing in Seattle is resulting in low-income residents moving farther from downtown to areas where access to high frequency public transit is weaker.   And, for low-income families that remain, the high cost of car ownership coupled with high housing prices.This project establishes a mechanism for subsidizing low-income residents’ use of the full spectrum of transportation options, through low-cost fares. Additionally, the City can leverage the Mobility MarketPlace to incentivize improved service in outlying neighborhoods or outside of traditional commute hours by private transportation providers for both cost and efficiency. Lastly, leveraging the potential of smart kiosks installed at downtown transit stations, travelers without smartphones will be able to access information.
Aging Population
As in many parts of the country, the number of seniors in Seattle, already 18% of the population, is anticipated to double in the next 10 years. Lacking alternatives to car ownership, seniors often hold on to their licenses beyond a point of safety. Once resigning their licenses, they face significant challenges from the high cost of alternatives to overreliance on friends and family, and ultimately the need for many to move out of their homes.Providing one-stop shopping for affordable, reliable, and convenient transportation alternatives, this project will help improve the opportunities for seniors to age in place with dignity at a significant cost savings to society.
Question 1 —* 2014 Census data, comparing growth rates of 50 largest cities, July 1, 2012 – July 1, 2013.
Smart Seattle —  5Description Response
Entry of Shared, Electric and Automated Vehicles
Committed to its Climate Action Goal of increasing 
electric vehicles, the City seeks to expedite the adoption of electric and automated vehicles entering the Seattle market.  However, the advent of shared, electric and automated vehicles has the potential to increase vehicle trips in the City.By consolidating citywide signals of demand for trips, this project rapidly expands the market for shared mobility services, and accelerates market entry of automated and electric vehicles. Likewise, through partnerships in supply, this project creates a framework to ensure that this shift and its outcomes are aligned with the public good. The University of Washington is willing to perform a detailed test of Level 3 automated transit vehicles in controlled public spaces. In doing so, the nation can gain the data needed to adopt the best policies and regulations to encourage the safe adoption of these vehicles.
Lack of Data
The public and private sector are motivated to innovate around transportation. However, many of the innovations rely on data and a communications system not currently available. For instance, one innovation in Europe, “mobility as a service,” requires a single payment gateway and collaboration between the public and private sectors.This project invests significantly in data collection and communications to spur a wave of public and private innovations beyond just the “Mobility MarketPlace.” Data will all be publicly available, subject to restrictions, and the APIs and source code that underlie the Mobility MarketPlace will be open-source, enabling both fast adoption around the country and the ability to speed further improvements.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Historical investments in hydropower make Seattle’s electricity the cleanest in the nation. Seattle’s municipal utility – Seattle City Light – has been carbon neutral since 2005. As valued as this advantage is in the fight against climate change, it puts transportation at the center of greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.By installing environmental sensors on Metro buses as part of our intelligent infrastructure, Seattle will be able to manage localized air quality in real time by incorporated the sensor data into its adaptive traffic control system.
Additionally, trip options will be presented by accounting 
for carbon-dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions in the trip options and incentives presented to users, this project increases the uptake of carbon-neutral travel.
Climate Resilience and Safety
Consistent with many cities across the country, Seattle faces an impressive collection of natural and human threats, such as earthquakes, severe storms, sea level rise, floods, and landslides. While not unique, these challenges are significant in a transportation network severely strained by the city’s rapid growth.The Mobility MarketPlace can become a powerful tool to influence travel behavior, especially in crisis situations. Ultimately this will reduce the number of single-occupancy vehicles on the road, and spur the adoption of safer automated vehicles and more environmentally-friendly electric vehicles.  Additionally, our systems can become a powerful tool to manage mobility in crisis situations, including the use of Metro buses and trains to provide emergency infrastructure such as communications and power generation.
— Question 1 6 — Smart SeattleTechnical Approach
Data Collection – The City and partners will 
install data collection equipment at fixed locations and on mobile, private and public vehicles that will complement the plethora of existing data from public and private partners. The equipment will be connected by an open communications architecture consisting of a regional high-bandwidth wireless network and 5.9GHz DSRC, backed by the partner agencies’ extensive fiber optic network and built infrastructure. Communications will be an open architecture Ethernet/IP network using multiple technologies. The network architecture will be based on established standards and designed for continuous expansion, improvement, and evolution. All local public agencies will have access to the network. By providing a unified marketplace for mobility services, the private sector will also be empowered to contribute to data collection efforts. Private sector data collection will be required to adhere to the policies and laws enforced through the Trusted Data Platform outlined in the following pages.
Data Collaborative – The data collaborative will 
facilitate the aggregation and analysis of multi-party data and will be capable of complex real-time analysis, modeling, and decision support. The project partners, along with a wide array of public and private service providers, will use these data to allow the continuous improvement of the transportation system.  For example, the data which describe the person throughput in SOVs, shared vehicles, and buses allows the city to optimize both their basic signal timing plans and the number of transit signal priority calls allowed on the arterials. This in turn speeds both arterial and transit movements, and those improvements are tracked, reported, and made available in the Mobility MarketPlace. By taking advantage of the data available through the 
connected vehicle network, we drive down the 
cost of managing the entire network, while also providing the tools to continually fine-tune its performance.
The collaborative addresses three key principles 
with respect to data-sharing: privacy, security, and transparency. Core to the collaborative is a “trust framework” that identifies the parties and their roles and responsibilities as members of the collaborative. The trust framework also establishes rules, guidelines, and a code of conduct to ensure that both data analysis and data handling are conducted in a manner that is compliant with relevant policy as determined by the data owners or governing bodies. Security, policy, and governance are all managed within the trusted data platform layer, ensuring the safe and responsible analysis and manipulation of data within the system. Detailed information is provided in Section 9
Implementation and Operation Approach –  
Our technical design and project management 
team will utilize the Systems Engineering process to develop the full concept of operations, design, and testing plan for the overall system and its individual components. The process will be supported by the use of the Connected Vehicle Reference Implementation Architecture (CVRIA v2.1) and SET-IT software. At the conclusion of the design phase, the project will make a full update to the Regional ITS Architecture. Where feasible, our designs will utilize published and de-facto standards such as NTCIP 1211 for Transit Signal Priority. During development of the systems, technical and operating documentation will be created so that system operators can be trained ahead of deployment. Some program elements include unique opportunities to be leveraged, such as Metro’s existing Connected Vehicles infrastructure which can be upgraded to deploy the 100 miles of DSRC without the need for extensive design or planning. It may be possible to complete this deployment in the first year of the project and be available for testing new systems.
Question 1 — Smart Seattle —  7Program Management  
Our program management structure will enable 
us to manage the multiple elements of the program in an effective and efficient manner. For clear lines of communication and accountability, the City of Seattle will act as the recipient of the federal award and will be responsible for compliance with regulatory and financial requirements.  The City will further hire outside program management experts to ensure that the project is delivered successfully.
This program management structure consists 
of an Executive Oversight Committee (EOC), Technical Advisory Group, and a Systems Engineering Group with multiple element-specific teams. The EOC will be responsible for overseeing

The Systems Engineering Group will do the actual development of the systems and overall integration, with project managers leading the development of each component overseen by an integrated team led by an overall program manager.
8 — Smart SeattleQuestion 2 —Seattle meets USDOT’s population characteristics 
for a Smart City and is listed as a qualifying city on the Smart Cities website.
a) Population – Based on 2010 census data, 
Seattle’s population is 608,660, near the upper middle of the USDOT’s specified 
range. 
b) Dense urban population – Seattle has several dense, mixed-use urban centers. 
The population density for the overall city is 17 persons per acre, and the employment 
density is 13.2 jobs per acre (net land acres 
in Seattle, excluding street right-of-way). Q2: Population Characteristics  
Describe the population characteristics of your city and 
show how it aligns with the USDOT’s characteristics for 
a Smart City.
c) Proportion of the population of its 
urbanized area – According to the 2010 
Census, Seattle’s population represents 20% 
of the urbanized area. This is significantly greater than the minimum 15% specified by 
the USDOT.
Smart Seattle —  9Q3: Other Characteristics  
Describe other characteristics of your city and show how 
it aligns with the USDOT’s characteristics for a Smart 
City.
Seattle is uniquely poised to be the United States’ 
premier, and USDOT’s signature, Smart City. The region is actively and significantly investing in public transportation; is championing leading-edge initiatives in shared mobility, electrification, transportation demand management, parking, bike share, and transit communications; has a progressive technology-driven business community, strong and committed public leadership, and a general population that is highly educated and progressive on transportation issues.
Existing Public Transportation System 
Seattle’s public transit system is a complex 
network of services. Bus and light rail serve the highest ridership, but these services are supplemented by commuter rail, monorail, and a rapidly growing streetcar network. 
King County Metro is a national leader in 
introducing new technologies and innovation into public transportation. King County Metro, with partners, has created a 60-mile bus rapid transit (BRT) system and implemented improvements including traffic signal coordination, transit signal priority, bus lanes, queue bypasses, and safety improvements. They have also created a range of tools to give customers up-to-date information on services, service disruptions, and innovations like the TripPool app that enables real-time carpooling. King County Metro was among the first agencies to provide real-time bus arrival information to riders via the Internet and phone. King County operates an energy-efficient fleet, including more than 150 all-electric trolley buses. 
Sound Transit operates express bus, commuter 
rail, and light rail service throughout King County and in two adjacent counties. Sound Transit serves approximately 34 million riders each year. Major capital investments, coupled with the region’s rapid growth, are pushing ridership levels up quickly – approaching 41 million riders for 2016.Conducive Environment
Seattle has the essential elements to be a 
showcase Smart City.
• Public Sector Innovation –  
The City has established one of the 
most innovative municipal agendas in the country, particularly related 
to transportation, energy, and the 
environment. The Seattle Department of Transportation is hard at work on a Shared 
Mobility Plan, the first of its kind in the 
country, which will provide a solid policy and regulatory framework for our Smart Cities 
proposal. Our municipal parking program 
regularly wins awards for innovation, such as performance-based pricing on a shoe-
string budget.  
 
Seattle’s municipal electric utility, Seattle 
City Light, has been carbon neutral since 
2005, the first electric utility in the nation to achieve this distinction. Seattle City Light has also maintained the longest continually 
operating energy conservation program 
in the country and, moving forward, has committed to meeting future load growth 
with 100% renewable energy.  
 
King County Metro manages to carry a 
larger percentage of our commuters on 
transit than any other city in the nation without an extensive rail system, made 
effective through the early adoption of 
technologies to prioritize buses. In addition, King County’s RapidRide BRT was the first 
and only authorized user of Intellidrive, 
the predecessor of what we now know as Connected Vehicles. In addition, WSDOT 
was an early adopter of the automated 
variable speed limit technology aimed at reducing congestion, improving traffic flow, 
and managing congestion.
• Smart Land Use – The State Growth Management Act mandates growth through 
infill development within an urban growth boundary. Seattle’s Comprehensive Plan 
focuses growth in up-zoned urban villages, 
around current and planned transit station areas. In the last 20 years, nearly three 
quarters of new Seattle households have 
located in neighborhoods that are easy to serve with transit.
— Question 3 10 — Smart Seattle• Tech Culture – In 2015, Citylab rated Seattle 
the 8th best city for startups in the world. 
More than 77 out of every 1,000 jobs are 
in the tech sector. Tech giants Amazon and Microsoft, powerhouse Boeing, and 
“smaller” startups such as Expedia, Redfin, 
Tableau, and Zillow are all anchored here. Additionally, Google, Facebook, Twitter 
and UBER have significant investments in 
Seattle. 
• Equity – Seattle is fundamentally committed 
to equity, including transportation equity, and implemented a first-in-the-nation racial 
equity initiative: the Seattle Race and Social 
Justice Initiative, that has been in place for more than a decade.  King County Metro 
currently offers ORCA Lift reduced-cost 
transit passes to income-qualified travelers. The City is working with car-share providers 
to expand into low-income neighborhoods 
and soon will be providing car-share subsidies for income-eligible residents 
beginning in 2016. Additionally, the City will 
launch a low-income bike share program this year.
• Connected Citizenry – Seattle’s annual tech 
survey suggests that 85% of residents have 
Internet at home, 89% of residents own 
mobile phones, and smartphone ownership is at 58% and rising by 11% per year. 
• Involved Citizenry – the Seattle public 
has demonstrated a firm and ongoing 
commitment to progressive transportation 
initiatives. In 2015, residents voted in favor of an historic 9-year, $930 million 
transportation levy that will enable an 
expansion of public transportation. 
•  A National Forum to Showcase Resilience 
to Climate Change – The Resilient America Roundtable of the National Academy of Science recently selected Seattle as 1 of 
only 3 pilot communities in the nation to 
demonstrate resilience in transportation, along with climate adaptation, equity, and 
economic growth. The City of Seattle and 
University of Washington play leading roles in this forum.Committed, Capable Leadership
The partnership that has been formed for this 
Smart City challenge is made up of leaders in public government, the business community, and private transportation who are dedicated to transforming transportation in the Seattle Metro area. Each member of our team has the people in place to support and implement this project throughout the period of performance. 
• The City of Seattle – Seattle is a high-
functioning city on the frontlines of technology and transportation innovation. 
Mayor Edward B. Murray is prepared to 
make the Smart City Challenge project a signature part of his administration. 
• King County Metro Transit – King County Metro’s Transit General Manager is 
firmly in support of this project. Metro is 
committed to the significant equipment and communications upgrades associated with 
this project. 
•  Business Community – Business leaders 
enthusiastically endorse the project. Former Governor Christine Gregoire’s Challenge 
Seattle, a business group comprised of CEOs of the 17 largest businesses in Seattle, and 
the Chamber of Commerce representing 
a combined workforce of 700,000 (or 32% of the 2.1 million jobs in the region) 
support the project. In addition, Microsoft 
is an established partner on our team and is committed to providing the necessary 
resources and technologies to make this 
project a success. 
• Private Transportation Providers – Critical private sector transportation providers including Lyft, Ford, UBER, Car2Go, 
DriveNow, GM and Zipcar support the 
initiative. 
Question 3 — Smart Seattle —  11Open Data Commitment
The City of Seattle has operated an enterprise 
geographic information system (GIS) for 20 years, while SDOT has shared transportation, parking, and other GIS data since 2010, most recently through the City’s Open Data Initiative. 
• Open Data Initiative – Since 2010, Seattle’s 
Department of Information Technology has maintained a robust open data platform, 
powered by Socrata, with hundreds of 
data sets including parking, transportation systems, public safety, land use, and many 
others. In 2015, SDOT established the 
“Open Data and Data-Driven Reporting Special Interest Group,” to collect, develop, 
and share open data and data-driven 
reporting resources. The agency has recognized open data, both internal and 
external, as a fundamental requirement for 
the sharing economy and the expansion of public-private transportation partnerships.
• Hackathons and Public-Private Data Sharing – Also last year, SDOT sponsored 
a Hack the Commute app contest that 
engaged over 150 volunteer participants in the use of city transportation and other 
data sets to build mobile apps. Similarly, 
the City’s bike share operator makes data publicly available and has supported data 
challenges.Commitment to Integrating with the 
Sharing Economy
Seattle has been on the frontlines of innovation 
in the sharing economy since its inception and has a fundamental commitment to ensuring the sharing economy is open to all. 
• Seattle was the first City in the country to 
recognize the need to adjust its regulatory framework to address taxis, vehicles for 
hire (VFH), and Transportation Network 
Companies (TNCs), and it continues to lead the national shared transportation 
conversation. The Seattle Department of 
Transportation, with King County Metro and other regional regulatory partners, initiated 
the first Shared Mobility Strategic Plan in 
the country. 
• Seattle has always provided a welcoming environment for shared mobility. FlexCar, the country’s first car sharing service, 
launched in Seattle in 1998, before 
evolving into ZipCar. Altogether, more than a half-dozen technology-driven car 
share companies currently operate in 
Seattle, including RelayRides, FlightCar, SideCar, Lyft, and Uber, as well as ZipCar 
and Car2Go.  The City will be providing 
car-share subsidies for income-eligible residents beginning in 2016.  The City is also 
investigating electric car share.
• The City of Seattle is poised to invest $5 million to expand bike share citywide, with 
an eye toward launching the first large-scale Generation 4.0 electric bike share system in 
the United States. The City will encourage 
low-income ridership with stations in low-income neighborhoods and membership 
subsidies. 
• Seattle will make an award imminently to a 
street furniture vendor for the addition of 
bus stops and free-standing kiosks equipped 
with internet enabled touch-screens, ensuring access to the Mobility MarketPlace 
for those without smartphones.

The Seattle project involves 
myriad small investments in sensors and other data collection equipment on roadside infrastructure and public and private vehicles, as well as data communication infrastructure and the Mobility Marketplace data collaborative.  All of these elements are difficult to show on a map.  A generalized map of Seattle’s transportation system is shown here for reference.
Question 4 — Smart Seattle —  13Q5: USDOT Vision Elements  
Describe how your holistic, integrated approach aligns 
to the twelve USDOT vision elements described in this 
solicitation.
#1: Urban Automation
The data platform enables urban automation, 
providing public and private data in real time. We will be looking at automating the feedback mechanism from various control systems, such that the sensors and other data collection infrastructure we install will enable future automation of active systems. Real-time information about traveler decisions made via the Mobility MarketPlace will alert systems such as adaptive traffic control about expected loads to improve proactive management. Examples include pedestrian collision avoidance applications or the ability to leverage Transit Signal Priority technology to initiate crosswalk signals ahead of the bus’s arrival.  Simultaneously the University of Washington is investigating and is willing to demonstrate implementing Level 3 automated buses for shuttle or loop applications.
#2: Connected Vehicles
This project will add 100 arterial miles of DSRC 
roadside infrastructure to Metro’s existing 4.9GHz Connected Vehicles network during the first year of the award. In addition to building upon this existing network, we will develop wide area wireless communications in the form of a shared regional high bandwidth, low-latency wireless network for public agency operations, allowing Metro to perform all data operations currently done at the transit base anywhere in the service area. This will allow Metro to potentially have the capability to reduce major capital investments. 
#3: Intelligent, Sensor-Based 
Infrastructure
Through this initiative, we will collect and 
combine live data from operators of all modes of transportation to create and share complete, real-time knowledge of the network’s performance, enabling direct and proactive management. This includes:
• On-street parking, loading zones and 
participating private parking facilities•  Advance notification of demand spikes 
from sources like ports and stadiums
•  Spot location air quality conditions
• •Freight, drayage and local delivery 
dispatch
We will use Metro’s 1,400 buses (representing 
12,000 daily vehicle trips) as well as streetcars, private shared vehicles, and other vehicles, as a sensor platform to collect real-time data integral to our intelligent infrastructure, including:
•  Automatic passenger counters on all buses 
by adding software to detect motion as 
people get on and off
•  TSP for all buses, by adding software 
which takes advantage of the improved 
location information available through the 
high speed continuous connected vehicle infrastructure
•  Intelligent bike racks and ADA securement
•  Air quality sensors
•  Video for image-aware systems
•  Emergency ad-hoc communications
• Emergency power generation
These data allow us to understand the 
performance of the transportation system, and therefore identify and take the steps needed to optimize that performance.
#4: Urban Analytics
The data platform will be a secure shared 
computing and data storage platform capable of managing live data streams, real-time transportation modeling, big data analytics and long-term storage. Drawing on the real-time data collected from infrastructure, we will be able to better measure the performance of our transportation network and uniquely 
— Question 5 14 — Smart Seattleprovide options to users through our Mobility 
MarketPlace. The data that we collect will be processed and pushed to the public according to policy appropriate to each individual set of data. This will consolidate new and existing data feeds in a single location, improving response time for powering real-time decision tools. Data will be prepared and distributed through APIs created by the data owners or developed by a trusted partner in the data collaborative, at the discretion of the data owner.
#5: User-Focused Mobility Services and 
Choices
This Mobility MarketPlace is designed to offer 
travel concierge services with information about their travel options, incentives for making system-optimal decisions, and a single payment gateway that provides a seamless user experience for all public and private transportation products. 
Vision Element #6: Urban Delivery and 
Logistics
This project will allow delivery companies to 
more efficiently move goods into and out of the city. With data sensors allowing for real-time information regarding the transportation network conditions, and the data collaborative processing and sharing this information, the data platform can provide dynamic routing for truck traffic and promote off-peak and overnight deliveries. It would also enable car share operators to combine passengers and packages in one trip, or to deliver packages to neighborhood freight consolidation centers – eliminating a trip for a small-parcel delivery truck. As automation offers ever-increasing options for residential package delivery, the data platform will optimize the mix of traditional deliveries, AV deliveries, or other currently experimental devices.
Vision Element #7: Strategic Business 
Models and Partnering Opportunities
Our team is a strong partnership of enOur 
team is a strong partnership of entities that will continue to work together throughout development of the Smart City project and into implementation, operations, and maintenance. With the commitment of several Seattle-located businesses, such as Microsoft, Amazon, BMW , Uber, and others, we will leverage the planned federal resources through cost sharing and in-kind donations wherever possible. The Data Collaborative model will foster new partnerships as the demands within the city continue to evolve. Please see our Appendix for letters of support gathered from our partners. 
Element #8: Smart Grid, Roadway 
Electrification and EV’s
This project will deploy smart charging 
infrastructure that includes piloting single payments for all charge points regardless of vendor. In addition to expediting EV adoption, this will generate usage pattern data, to further planning and operations. Separately the City will be partnering with BMW to launch electric car share; the City is pursuing an expansion of bike share incorporating electric bikes.
Vision Element #9: Connected, Involved 
Citizens
The data gathered throughout our transportation 
network will be processed and made available to the public. We will look to the citizens and businesses of Seattle to play an active role in creating new and innovative transportation services. Further, the Mobility MarketPlace provides options to all users – regardless of age, income, and access to banking accounts and smart phones. By providing subsidies for low-income residents, ensuring access to shared mobility options, emphasizing the ability for seniors to age in place by providing affordable and convenient transportation, and offering non-smartphone information outlets like panels at bus stops, we’re making sure that the Smart City concept benefits and involves the entire community. 
Vision Element #10: Architecture and 
Standards
The project will build on Metro’s existing The 
project will build on Metro’s existing architecture for connected vehicles. The Seattle region is known for being early adopters of ITS and IT standards. In particular, King County Metro drove the national definition of transit connected vehicle standards for transit signal priority. The standards were enabled by the adoption of other Seattle standards-based systems, including the public service communications systems and deployment of WSDOT’s ITS stations along the transit signal priority corridors. 
Question 5 — Smart Seattle —  15Vision Element #11: Low-Cost, Efficient, 
Secure, and Resilient Information and Communications Technology
Our project will build on Seattle’s existing 
information and communications technology (ICT). Leveraging existing investments decreases the cost of becoming a “smart city” and improves the ROI for putting this infrastructure in place. In addition to taking advantage of the existing in-place infrastructure, our key project partners of Microsoft and UW will work to ensure that the system we develop considers privacy and security as key functions.  
Vision Element #12: Smart Land Use
This project is consistent the region’s efforts to 
reduce reliance on private vehicles, reduce the amount of land and building costs associated with vehicle storage, and better manage increasing travel demands within limited rights of way, all with the goal of creating a denser, more livable city. Creating Measurable Impact through 
Technology Solutions 
The Seattle Smart City concept involves 
combining a host of technology solutions to create a novel approach to enabling a healthy transportation ecosystem where suppliers and consumers have much closer to perfect real-time knowledge of the transportation market – and where the overall capacity of the transportation system is optimized, eliminating the need for costly physical infrastructure.  Data from the Data Collaborative makes measuring impact possible. Overarching data points include reduction in traffic delays; increase in electric and automated vehicles; and reductions in single-occupancy vehicle trips, overall vehicle-miles travelled, and greenhouse gases emitted.
— Question 5 16 — Smart SeattleTechnical Risks
Transportation Provider Data – High Risk  
Data provided for key modes may be limited 
or not timely enough to be able to effectively incentivize users in real time. This risk will be mitigated by building a core data set that provides coverage for the most critical parts of city (i.e., arterial corridors) and modes of transport.  Data can also be purchased from different private companies to supplement the available data.  Finally, multiple technology options exist and can be used to collect data (e.g., arterial performance data can be obtained from signal systems, private providers, participating TNC vehicles, or Wi-Fi/Bluetooth instrumentation).
Privacy Harm from the Collection and Use of 
Sensitive Data – Medium Risk  
This project introduces risk related to loss of personal privacy or commercial information. Research has proven that geo-spatial data can be easily used to re-identify persons, even when no other variable is at hand. To mitigate this risk, privacy experts at the UW Tech Policy Lab will work with SDOT and its partners to adopt protocols to govern the collection, use, and distribution of  data in the interest of privacy. Working within the Data Collaborative we will develop and implement policies and protocols to govern the data in the interest of subjects, incorporating technological advancements in aggregation, encryption, and authentication.
Failures of Cybersecurity with Sensitive Data, 
System Controls, and Networked Devices – Medium Risk  
The proliferation of information and communication technologies and the rapid adoption of transport technologies with automated and networked control systems envisioned in this project raise the risk of failures in cybersecurity. Each investment has the practical effect of increasing the attack surface for cybercriminals, whose economic or political targets may include sensitive data, system controls, or networked transportation devices, as well as the people who use them. To mitigate this risk, cybersecurity experts at UW and Microsoft will work closely with public and private partners to select secure technologies, test technologies as they are deployed (e.g., penetration tests), and devise mitigating security measures. Similarly, the Data Collaborative will be operated on a platform that is trusted – a trust that is made possible by investments in the technology and organization necessary to keep the data secure.
Policy Risks
Payment Gateway Based on ORCA  –  
Medium Risk  
An upgrade of the Seattle region’s unified 
fare payment  card, ORCA, is currently in development, a process involving multiple jurisdictions and transit agencies across the region. The ORCA card is the most viable tool currently for the MarketPlace’s unified payment gateway, but will depend on high levels of coordination between public entities and between public and private service providers. To mitigate this risk, all lead partners Microsoft, UW and the City are prepared to develop a payment gateway independent of ORCA as needed.Q6: Risks  
Identify and rate key technical, policy, and institutional 
risks associated with the deployment vision and discuss 
plans for mitigating those risks.

Question 6 — Smart Seattle —  17Equity  – High Risk  
All residents, including low-income residents, 
seniors, minorities, and those less comfortable with technology must benefit from this project. By linking the ORCA fare card to the Mobility MarketPlace, we have direct access to ORCA Lift, the program already in place to subsidize transit use for these communities. To further mitigate this risk, partners will employ specific efforts to engage the broad spectrum of the population: for instance, emphasizing the ability for seniors to age in place, providing subsidies for low-income residents, incentivizing private transportation providers to provide service in low-income neighborhoods, and having “smart” bus stop panels with the functionality of a smartphone. A robust public engagement process will solicit input and feedback from all members of the community, including those listed above. 
Institutional Risks
Private Entity Participation – Medium Risk  
As part of its project scoping, the City of 
Seattle has reached out to many major private companies regarding the data collaborative. All have signed letters of support based on an understanding of the project. While these companies have historically been reluctant to share their data with public entities, Seattle’s project adds two things that have never been in the equation before – hugely valuable information for private operators, in the form of data on real-time system performance, and the potential to reach a large new customer base. These two proposal elements have attracted the support of the needed private partners. 
Slow App Uptake – Low Risk  
To mitigate the risk of slow adoption, we have 
taken two key steps. First, the data collaborative is designed to encourage other app developers to access the same information (and incentives) and deliver it in newer, better ways.  Second, the City has created a built-in audience through its partners. The City of Seattle provides an audience of 176,000 commuters through its mandatory Commute Trip Reduction Program and the Chamber of Commerce provides an audience of 700,000 employees. Project Delivery and Interagency Coordination – Low Risk  
Although our team takes project delivery and excellence seriously and the team has a track record of successfully delivering a large number of projects with comparable size and scope (see Section 12), we have taken further steps to mitigate risk. As noted previously, we have a strong multi-agency oversight function built into our program management approach and plan to hire outside program management experts to ensure that the project is delivered across agency interests. Further, SDOT most recently developed, launched, and is administering a dynamic new system that standardizes the entirety of project management and oversight. This has woven in accountability, real-time risk mitigation..

— Question 9 22 — Smart SeattleData integration for improved 
transportation options 
The data collection and communication 
infrastructure installed as part of this project is 
intended to ignite and support future public and private sector services. Travelers will be able to 
make mode and schedule decisions based on 
real-time information and pricing, leading to decisions that are aligned to support the health 
of the transportation system and public good. 
Existing trip planning products can incorporate the payment gateway and/or incentives and then 
push them out to their customers, magnifying 
the overall impact.
Smart Freight – Optimization of goods 
movement is as important as the optimization of people movement. The data platform can provide 
dynamic routing for truck traffic, and promote 
off-peak and overnight deliveries. It would also enable car share operators to combine 
passengers and packages in one trip, or to deliver 
packages to neighborhood freight consolidation centers – eliminating a trip for a small-parcel 
delivery truck.  
In addition to improvements to package delivery, 
cooperation with the Northwest Seaport Alliance 
can reduce drayage truck queues at the Alliance’s Seattle Harbor container terminals. This in turn 
reduces truck idling and related greenhouse 
gas emissions, while providing an opportunity for truck drivers and drayage firms to increase 
productivity by avoiding busy terminals.        
Mobility as a Service – By providing a payment 
gateway and consolidated transportation data, 
it is anticipated that the private sector will create “Mobility as a Service” packages in which 
they allow users to pay a subscription fee for a 
package of transportation services by different providers.
Operations – In order to effectively manage a 
multi-faceted transportation system in a city, 
it is imperative to have the right information 
about the current state of the system as a whole – across publically- and privately-owned 
transportation methods. The data collaborative 
will enable service providers and industry researchers to create better tools for city 
operators that connect transportation assets 
across public and private providers. This will lower the cost of operation innovation, and 
shorten time to market for such services.Technical Architecture
Communications Networks – Vehicles, 
infrastructure, centers and travelers will be connected by an open Ethernet/IP network 
communications architecture using multiple 
technologies. The network architecture will be based on established standards and designed 
for continuous expansion, improvement, and 
evolution. The communications infrastructure will include a regional high-bandwidth wireless network and 5.9GHz DSRC deployed on Metro’s RapidRide BRT corridors. These wireless 
components will be backed by the partner 
agencies’ extensive fiber optic network and built infrastructure. All local public agencies and select 
private transportation fleets will have access to 
the network.
Trusted Data Platform – Connecting data across 
public and private parties has tremendous 
potential for unlocking next generation 
technologies. It also comes with significant risk. Before we unlock the potential of these multi-
party data collaboratives, we must develop a 
policy and trust framework for this collaboration to take place in a way that is safe for the public 
and for individual users. 
Parties interested in contributing or utilizing data 
within the Data Collaborative have the ability to 
do so under a policy appropriate for a specific user or organization. The Data Collaborative 
will support real-time advanced analytics and 
modeling, making the data enticing not just to private sector transportation providers, but to 
researchers and government agencies alike. The 
intent is to provide a trusted environment for these public-private collaborations to take place, 
enabling connected, multi-modal, transportation 
applications to be built and delivered to the ecosystem without sacrificing security or testing 
personal privacy. 
The Data Collaborative will be operated by a 
non-governmental, disinterested third party, and advised by a Board of Directors comprised of 
representatives from participating government 
agencies and private sector partners. Both public and private sector users will fund the 
operating costs of the collaborative through a 
subscription to use the data and services. Once established, a single data collaborative can serve 
as the foundation for connected services across 
all agencies in a city or region. It is not limited to the transportation sector. Furthermore, after 
Question 9 — Smart Seattle —  23testing this model in Seattle, the trust framework, 
policy, and architecture can be replicated across 
other cities with minimal technical effort. The 
City of Seattle is well positioned to establish the first instance of this environment in partnership 
with Microsoft and extensive support from the 
University of Washington’s Tech Policy Lab and eSciences Institute. 
Data Collaborative Secure Asset and Access 
Management – Security, policy, and governance 
are top priorities to which we intend to dedicate significant attention. Microsoft has developed an architecture called the Trusted Data Platform that 
will be the foundation of this development. 
The Trusted Data Platform enables the 
cross-functional sharing of data and assets 
between public and private entities without compromising security requirements at any 
level. This infrastructure is designed to manage 
highly classified secure data as well as publicly developed open data. Access to data is controlled 
by a series of gatekeepers that enforce policy 
on behalf of the data owner. In the case of sensitive, government-owned, classified data, 
the data owner may elect to trust a data science 
consultancy to, for example, develop a learning model to better understand traveler behavior. 
The University of Washington eScience Institute 
will serve as such a consultancy for researchers, non-profits, and commercial sponsors who 
need support working with large, noisy, and 
heterogeneous transportation data. Once that learning model is developed with a single trusted 
partner, classified data is no longer required in 
order to utilize the output of the model in various services. Those data models can then be made 
available to a broader set of users based on a 
different set of policies. 
The computing environment provided at each 
stage of the workflow will draw upon appropriate data management and analytics services 
provided by commercial cloud vendors.  In all 
cases, the approach is to “bring the computation to the data” rather than “bring the data to 
the computation”: models are assumed to be 
developed, trained, and deployed within the protected (and scalable) computing environment.
This workflow is essential as many of the 
challenges facing transportation are solved only 
when we collaborate across the broad variety of 
services users rely on for mobility. The Trusted Data Platform provides a framework in order to establish trust across parties under a controlled 
set of policies. 
Policies
The existing data we collect is all consistent with 
all laws and policies related to retention, public 
records and privacy.  At this point, the data we propose to collect as part of this proposal 
is similar in nature to that which is currently 
collected. We plan to continue complying with the same laws and policies and will assess in the

Question 9 — Smart Seattle —  25Q10: Standards  
Describe your approach for using existing standards, 
architectures, and certification processes?
The Seattle region is known for being early 
adopters of ITS and IT standards. In particular, King County Metro drove the definition of transit connected vehicle standards for transit signal priority. The standards were enabled by the adoption of other Seattle standards-based systems including the public service communications systems and deployment of WSDOT’s ITS stations along transit signal priority corridors. For the transit signal priority corridors to be effective, the underlying communications infrastructure could not be deployed without comprehensive, multi-agency communication architecture and cooperative agreements. Moreover, complex projects in general would not be possible without coordination through the regional ITS architecture update process. These processes and coordination relationships are already in place in the city.  Several of the Seattle team members have developed project and enterprise architecture models for complex systems such as the Smart City Challenge. The processes in place are evolutionary, not static. The architectures are living documents, capturing changes, lessons learned, best practices, and performance criteria for project implementation. This process is inherent in each agency’s project portfolio management process.
With respect to interacting and feeding lessons 
learned back to standards organizations, many of the key King County IT and Metro staff participate in ITS standard development activities. Our private sector partners are leaders in standard development activities, including participation on the ISO Technical Committee 204 on ITS, which is responsible for a harmonized connected vehicle suite of standards. Others on the team are members of the SAE and IEEE connected vehicle and communications standards groups who are promulgating Internet of Things, Communications (DSRC), Big Data and Connected Vehicle standards, all of which will be critical in deploying a consistent set of standards for this challenge.

Question 11 — Smart Seattle —  27Q12: Capacity  
Provide evidence that establishes your capacity to take 
on a project of this magnitude.
The City of Seattle and its partners are fully 
equipped and enthusiastic to take on the Smart City Challenge. From executive leadership to infrastructure readiness, the city is well-positioned to provide a replicable model for highly successful Smart City projects.
Capacity for Large Projects – The City of 
Seattle has recently managed a series of large, high-profile projects, many including federal funding. Examples include the Mercer Corridor Reconstruction Project completed in 2015 ($150M), the Spokane Street Viaduct Expansion completed in 2012 ($163M), and the South Lake Union Streetcar completed in 2007 ($53M).
Executive Commitment – Seattle’s Mayor, Ed 
Murray, and King County Metro GM, Kevin Desmond, are dedicated proponents of urban innovation and firmly behind the Seattle Smart Cities initiative.  They are joined by Governor Jay Inslee, the Port of Seattle’s CEO Ted Fick, Northwest Seaport Alliance CEO John Wolfe , and many others who have submitted letters of support. 
Workforce Capacity – Seattle’s project delivery 
approach recognizes that a robust and truly visionary Smart City project will not be fully delivered by agency staff. Contracted services will play a significant role in the partners’ timely project implementation, and Seattle is fortunate to have one of the country’s largest and most vibrant tech communities at its disposal. No city in the US boasts a better environment to immediately acquire and train top tech talent.
Infrastructure Readiness – Seattle and its 
partners own and operate approximately 250 miles of fiber. This allows full functionality of the project’s DSRC and data collection components immediately upon installation. 
Management Capabilities – Since 2013, 
SDOT has developed and fine-tuned an asset management plan that supports state-of-the-art business practices in financial management, risk management, and triple-bottom-line decision-making.  Additionally, the City will be hiring outside project management experts to assist.
— Question 12 28 — Smart SeattleQ13: Leverage Funding  
Describe any opportunities to leverage Federal 
resources through cost share, in-kind donations, and 
partnering.
Each of the project partners has made significant 
investments, and continues to invest heavily, in smart city projects. A few of the most significant and far-reaching investments supporting this USDOT Smart Cities project include:
• Microsoft Trusted Data Platform – Microsoft is establishing a next-generation model of public-private data collaborative, using the USDOT-funded collaborative as a template for emergency response, utilities, and numerous other public-service domains. The Data Collaborative that is established by this Smart City project is expected to become a template for trust frameworks that enable public-private collaboration in all government or public service sectors.
• Seattle Transportation electrification initiative – This initiative is working to electrify a significant portion of the city fleet by 2027 and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles and other electrified transportation options across the City – including transit, car share, corporate fleets, and more.
• SDOT Bus Rapid Transit program – SDOT 
is investing $63 million for extensive improvements to the city’s frequent transit service network, part of bringing 10- to12-minute transit service to 72% of Seattle’s population by 2025 (increased from 26% in 2015).
• King County Metro vehicle electrification program  – Metro currently has underway a 
software-based transit signal priority system and an existing integrated onboard platform that will host the new sensors. Likewise the region has underway an upgrade to the ORCA unified payment system.The City and its partners seek 
to continue their pioneering, groundbreaking approach to Smart City solutions and thriving urban environments. Extensive previous investments, coupled with a perfectly timed infusion of Smart City Challenge funding, will open the door for a newly sustainable transportation ecosystem. In close collaboration with USDOT and the national Smart City Community, the City of Seattle is prepared to become the recognized, replicable model for Smart City projects throughout the nation.

Part 1 – VISION NARRATIVE  
 
I. Introduction  
The City of Shreveport (COS) is pleased to submit its proposal  for the United States Department 
of Transportation’s (USDOT) Smart City Challenge. Shreveport accounts for more than 66% of 
the 298,317  population for the Census -designated place and is a regional center for employment, 
education, medicine and entertainment for the Ark -La-Tex region serving northwest Louisiana, 
southwest Arkansas, and East Texas. The cen tral business district of d owntown Shreveport  
supports an estimated 14,000 jobs and is seeing renewed growth in the housing, retail, and 
entertainment sectors. Our urban center is the focus of much of the investment we propose in this 
narrative, however, we intend to look at technology and solutions that will have an impact 
throughout the local transportation system by providing citizens with safe and efficient 
transportation alternatives.  
Our approach for this challenge is to focus on 
transferability and knowledge sharing . We have 
already started a transformation of our 
transportation sector and are sharing our lessons 
with state (Louisiana Public Transit Association) 
and regional (South West Transit Association) 
transportation associations through leadership on 
those boards of directors. The technology and 
resources available through the Smart City 
Challenge will allow us to set even more 
ambitious goals as we rebrand and redefine how 
transportation systems should work.  
 
Shreveport does not have the infrastructure or 
technology resources of cities like Austin, 
Boston , and San Francisco , but by showing 
successful implementation of innovative technologies in Shreveport, we will demonstrate that 
forward -thinking transportation strategies are within reach for all mid -sized cities. The activities 
proposed in this narrative are primarily cent ered on our public transit sys tem, but we aim to 
demonstrate that strengthening public transportation can address larger transportation -related 
constraints such as parking and public safety .  
 
Sending the Right Signals – 
Expected Outcomes  
Improve Safety  – Accidents beget 
accidents; greater ac cess to traffic 
information can keep citizens off of 
congested highways and limit secondary 
collisions.  
Enhance Mobility  – People do not like to 
wait. People do however like options. 
Making it easy to choose the best mode of 
transportation and facilitating transfers 
between modes will get people to their 
destinations faster.  
Address Climate Change  – More people 
staying out of their cars and jumping on 
transit within downtown will decrease 
congestion and reduce emissions. Doing it 
with electric v ehicles is lagniappe.  City of Shreveport

The USDOT recognizes that t he success of this initiative  depends largely on leadership and the 
policy environment of the selected applicant. City leaders in Shreveport are committed  to driving 
change and progress  as highlighted in the Mayor’s strategic plan for 2015 -2019. Through 
financial support of programs s uch as the Entrepreneurial  Accelerator Program , city involvement 
in the award -winning Shreveport Common place -making  initiative , and recognition by Louisiana 
Clean Fuels as municipalit y of the year for 2013  and 201 4, the Mayor, City Council, and city 
depar tment heads are  demonstrating that  all arms of local government are embracing initiatives 
focused on improving  the quality of life and fostering economic  growth .  
SporTran, the public  transportation system  for Shreveport -Bossier City, is following the City ’s 
footsteps in implementing new technology and making system changes that align with the Smart 
City Challenge goals.  In 2017, SporTran will introduce a new route structure aimed at decreasing 
travel time and improvin g connectivity throughout the c ity. The new rou te structure includes a 
downtown circulator that we propose as an ideal route  for introducing and testing driverless 
vehicles and smart -grid technology . We are in the process of constructing a new intermodal 
transportation facility that will house SporTran, intercity bus providers, and potentially Amtrak 
which has scheduled a test train between Dallas and Shreveport later this month on February 16. 
After the restructuring, the City  will also redefine how the current downtown bus terminal is 
used. This center  will remain a transfer station for fixed route bus service, but there are a 
sufficient number of vehicles lanes to use this facility as a hub for electric and automated vehicle 
technology.  
The City of Shreveport has made major strides in recen t years rolling out traffic signal 
prioritization  (TSP) , traffic sensors, and other Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)  
equipment to improve traffic flows and enhance public safety. The City coordinates closely with 
the regional DOTD traffic managemen t center (TMC) for upgrades to aging infrastructure and 
technological improvements that aid in moving traffic safely and efficiently throughout the 
Shreveport -Bossier metropolitan area.  Expenditures on TSP equipment to date total $1.2 million, 
and we look to triple this amount by the end of 2016. Additionally, t he Shreveport -Bossier area 
presently maintains a fiber optic communication ring. This system allows for intelligent 
transportation element previously deployed to work together and communicate with th e 
municipalities and the TMC. We propose to expand  this network to support the  connected 
vehicle and urban analytics solutions described in this proposal  and other innovations that are 
developed out of our collaboration with area technology firms . 
In addit ion to City investments in transportation infrastructure, Caddo Parish government is  
committed to safety and mobility improvements through such endeavors as the bike-way m aster 
plan and Safe Routes to Schools Program. Additionally, the Northwest Louisiana Council of 
Governments and the Bike Shreveport movement  are taking a leading role in advocating for City of Shreveport  
Smart City Challenge

improved bicycle infrastructure and bike safety efforts. Funding has been allocated for  signage 
and lane striping for an initial five bike routes  that conne ct the new intermodal transit facility 
with downtown, the Shreveport riverfront, and residential neighborhoods throughout the urban 
core.  
Above all , the timing is right for this project in Shreveport. From the Mayor down, there is a 
commitment to improving  the quality of life and expanding economic opportunity in the 
community. The Smart City Challenge will provide a catalyst for integrating government 
services with the sharing economy, not only in transportation, but in public safety, tourism, 
economic dev elopment, beautification, and more. As the best place to start  a business in the 
United States  according to a 2015 WalletHub report , we have the  entrepreneurial capacity and 
business community support to leverage the expertise and resources that the Depart ment of 
Transportation and Vulcan bring to this initiative. At the same time we recognize that whatever 
we do must be scalable and making data and research available to the private sector will be  one 
of the  keys to making the most of the Smart City Challen ge investment.  
 
II. The Shreveport Vision  
 
A. Challenges and Opportunities  
There are a number of key challenges that we propose to address through the Smart City 
Challenge by developing solutions that are cost effective and replicable.  Promoting mode choice, 
expanding the scope of how data is used, and strengthening decision -making through cross -
sector collaboration are a few of the ways that we will approach transportation issues in our 
community.  
Tailor -made Transportation.  As stated in the introduction, our vision focuses primarily on public 
transit. As such, making public transit a more attractive 
alternative is a key challenge that we propose to address. 
We recognize that the majority of citizens will not use 
fixed -route b us service  as their primary mode  of 
transportation ; however, rethinking how and where we 
operate  and introducing new technology can make public 
transit a more viable option for  a larger segment of the 
population . We have already started adding features suc h 
as real -time bus tracking and on -board Wi-Fi (currently 
in pilot phase), and we plan to roll out pay -by-phone 
ticketing in 2016. While these features may attract new 
ETP: Experience Transit Project  
 
In major urban centers, household 
economics push people to public 
transit. In typical mid -sized cities, the 
cost to commute and park is 
competitive with public transit. As a 
result, public transit largely exists to 
serve the transit dependent 
population. O ur proposed project 
looks at innovative ways to make 
public transit more attractive for 
regular commuters, lunchtime riders, 
and night owls alike.   City of Shreveport

riders, they are primarily intended to make transit easier for our current customers. Bringing new 
riders into the system takes bigger and bolder planning, and innovative technology must be a part 
of that planning.  
A downtown circulator is part of the new SporTran route system that will launch in 2017. The 
circulator will connect the central business district with a new intermodal transit facility , and 
there is an opportunity to expand this plan to incorporate driverless vehicles to connect with 
peripheral  parking. We are also exploring the option of adding service designed with the lunch 
crow d in mind. Combining this approach with public access vehicle charging stations at the 
peripheral  parking locations would help promote clean technology and reduce operating costs 
over the life of the circulator vehicles. We propose to partner with American  Electric Power 
(AEP) / Southwest Electric Power Company (SW EPCO ) and local universities  to test the 
impacts and the viability of electric vehicle infrastructure to help address the “Chicken or the 
Egg” dilemma noted in the Beyond Traffic 2045  document.  
A much more ambitious proposal is to use automated, electric vehicles for fixed route individual 
or shared -ride “taxi” service. The route system for this service would not be as extensive as our 
bus service, but it would introduce a new form of public tran sportation to appeal to a broader 
segment of riders  – especially at night when service is more limited . We propose to use the 
current SporTran bus terminal in downtown Shreveport as the hub for this service. The 
infrastructure is in place  to support the ve hicle traffic; however, we would need to add charging 
stations for the taxis that could also support the downtown circulator vehicles as they pass 
through the facility. The fare for this service would ideally fall between the price of bus service 
and the c ost of taking a taxi  or ride service . Testing the pricing model will be a significant part of 
our project . We appreciate that private providers such as Uber and Ly ft are meeting a growing 
segment of the transportation demand, but there is still an unmet ne ed for more price conscious 
consumers who might not always have time to wait for traditional bus service .  
Letting the Data Loose . The reality is that substantial amounts of data are already available, or 
could be made available through relatively small in vestments, but this data does not always 
benefit the optimal range of stakeholders. Shreveport, like most cities, is already collecting data 
on a wide range of indi cators for internal use and deployment. Over the past two  years, SporTran 
has installed auto matic v ehicle locator, real-time passenger information, and automated 
passenger counter systems on its buses to allow for data -driven decision -making and to provide 
better schedule information to passengers. There are opportunities to expand the pool of us ers for 
this data, and for other transportation information, by creating a culture of open data and 
partnering with private sector companies that can benefit from increased access to data.

Additionally, we will look at ways to get the most out of existing data by looking for new ways 
to deploy it. “Connection Protection” is a concept we have explored with our Automatic Vehicle 
Locator  (AVL)  system provider, Syncromatics  Corporation , whereby automated messages would 
be sent from bus to bus to coordinate arrivals at main connection points/intersections throughout 
the City. Using this technology, bus operators would be alerted if they need to wait at an 
intersection to take passengers transferri ng from another bus.  On -board passenger displays could 
also provider passengers with information on arrival times for connecting routes. These proposed 
features would reduce the risk of missed connections and help passengers cut down on travel 
times.  
 
Another idea we would like to pursue builds off of the fact that the City of Shreveport literally 
has eyes and ears everywhere – city employees who could easily trans mit data about events and 
incidents if there was a technology platform that would support information flows without 
breaking the bank. Currently, information about roadway debris, accidents, power outages or 
other even ts in Shreveport may be called in over a short -wave 
radio, but the process of getting this information into the right 
hands is inefficient. A  “Civic Communications” system would 
ideally integrate with existing hardware used by different 
departments for ong oing data collection, but would result in a 
back -end messag ing system that would get specific data to 
targeted end users. For example, a bus operator could hit a pre -
set icon on the bus’s Mobile Data Terminal /Global Positioning 
System  to send map -based ale rts for “excessive litter” to a 
public works team. Or police responding to the scene of an 
accident could feed data back into the regional traffic 
management system and public traffic displays through 
laptops that are installed on all vehicles.  This type o f 
system would have clear benefits for transportation systems by getting information out faster, but 
the impacts would spill over into other sectors and improve the overall efficiency of government 
services.   
 
A Team Effort . Coordination between different  transportation modes is a challenge for all cities, 
particularly when budgets are constrained and siloed between departments. Our project 
management approach addresses this challenge by making sure that the right partners and 
stakeholders are at the table  and that decisions on where investments are made are based on the 
potential reach of the project rather than on the needs of a specific department.    
 
Mobile Data Terminals are an example of 
smart technology investments that can 
feed into a comprehensive urban 
analytics system  City of Shreveport  
Smart City Challenge  
Page 7 
 
 
The City of Shreveport currently uses traffic signal prioritization  (TSP)  for public safety vehicles  
and has invested more than $ 1.2 on TSP infrastructure  to date, with an additional $2.4 million 
investment in the final design stage . Before the Smart City Challenge, the city traffic engineering 
division and the public transportation department started di scussing funding options for 
collaborating to get the most out of the city’s  investments. Expanding this system to  includ e 
public transit vehicles in this system would facilitate traffic flows and help keep buses on 
schedule.  Since the majority of the cost  involved with this system is related to infrastructure at 
the intersections, the incremental investment in bringing this technology to the public transit fleet 
is financially feasible  – for some parts of some routes .  
Although this technol ogy is already w idely used for b us rapid t ransit  (BRT) , we propose to 
introduce it throughout our regular route system to demonstrate how this technology can improve 
the overall on -time performance of fixed route bus service and contribute to increased ridership 
and impro ved customer satisfaction.  We recognize that trying to bring every traffic signal on 
every route into the system is not a realistic goal. Using on-time performance data from our AVL 
system, we can see where our trouble spots are on our routes and coordinat e to prioritize future 
traffic engineering investments that have the greatest payoff  for all city departments . 
How autonomous vehicles will be  deployed is another example of a decision -making process 
that will best be addressed by a range of stakeholders. Transit decisions are in many cases made 
independently by transit operators , looking at metrics such as ridership and passenger revenue. 
While these are important indicators for determining the effectiveness of transit routes, they do 
not always adequately  address needs of other stakeholders such as public safety officials and 
economic development organizations. For example, moving people from peripheral parking to 
downtown buildings might not look like a transit success, but in Shreveport, it could open up  
more than 245,000 square feet of office space that is sitting empty due to a shortage of on -site 
parking.  
 
B. Program Management  Approach  
Our vision relies on collaboration between city departments, other local government agencies, 
communit y partners, local universities, vendors , and a host of othe r stakeholders, and fostering 
an enabling environment that is conducive to innovation will be a primary objective of our 
project team. Given that the majority of the project elements are directly re lated to public 
transportation, the General Manager for SporTran will chair a project steering committee, with 
the mayor’s Executive Assistant of Governmental Affairs  serving as vice chair and partnership 
coordinator. The City Attorney will also be heavily  involved in the planning and implementation 
of the project to help identify and address policy constraints and work with the mayor and City 
Council to amend or enact legislation as need to support project objectives. The steering City of Shreveport  
Smart City Challenge  
Page 8 
 
 
committee will initially oversee the develop ment  of the full proposal for submission to USDOT, 
but will ultimately be responsible for drafting a project work plan, developing a performance 
monitoring plan, overseeing implementation by city 
departments, partners, subcontractors, an d technology 
companies , and ensuring that milestones and objectives 
are met.   
Performance management is a key aspect of the Smart 
City Challenge, and our approach to this project will 
mirror how we operate as a city.  As referenced above, the 
City of Shreveport released a strategic plan in 2015 as a 
roadmap for the mayor’s first term in office. This plan 
includes goals and indicators for each department as a 
way to quantify and publicly disseminate information on 
how ta x dollars are being spent. We present illustrative performance measures in section IX. 
below,  but the fact that we are already implementing a monitoring and evaluation system at the 
city level demonstrates a commitment to results -based management.   
We have  included letters of support from local partners as attachments to Part 1 of this 
application to reflect the coordination that is already taking place , but if we are selected as a 
finalist, we know that finding industry -leading partners will not be a probl em – and that is 
potentially the most exciting aspect of the Smart City Challenge.  We look forward to receiving 
technical assistance and investments from USDOT partners Vulcan, Mobileye, and other experts 
in their fields who are looking for the right mix o f local leadership, demographics, and 
infrastructure to bring new technology into the mainstream.  
 
III. Shreveport – A Great Place to Call Home  
Shreveport’s 2010 Census count put the population at 198, 533 out of the 298,317 for the Census -
designated place, but as home to Barksdale Air  Force Base, the University Health Level 1 trauma 
center , and the Port of Caddo -Bossier, Shreveport has infrastructure and resources that make it a 
regional hub for recreation, tourism, transportation, commerce, and social services.  With a 
population density of approximately 1,900 people per square mile, Shreveport has the 
transportation advantages and challenges that you find in any typical mid -sized U.S. city.  
Shreveport has a transportation network that includes I -20 and I -49 and  190 miles of arterial 
roadways. It is generally accepted that you can get anywhere in Shreveport in approximately 20 
minutes , unless you ge t stopped by a train or come up on an accident on the highway . Looking to 
the future though, further expansion  of thi s network  is becoming cost prohibitive as 
Coordination? We do that!  
 
One of the objectives for SporTran in 
the Strategic Plan for 2015 -2019 is to 
establish a transit improvement 
committee to get riders and other 
community stakeholders more 
involved in planning and problem 
solving. The committee’s first meeting 
was in Januar y and included 
stakeholders from largest hospital 
system in the region, Southern 
University in Shreveport, and the 
Shreveport Common cultural district.   City of Shreveport  
Smart City Challenge

infrastructure resources are stretched thin trying to maintain existing roadways and bridges. This 
situation is typical in most mid -sized U.S. cities, where sprawl is putting a strain on 
transportation systems. The  Shreveport -Caddo Master Plan 2030  puts an emphasis on 
integration of land use and transportation, including enhancing public transportation inside the 
“beltway” as a means to re -establish the urban core.  
Politically and financially, Shreveport is stable and the current administration is advancing a 
number of bond -funded capital improvement projects that were previously stalled. Mayor Tyler 
and the Shreveport City Council were elected to four year terms in December 2014, and in 
February 2016 the Mayor will publically release the first annual scorecards for city departments 
highlighting successes and shortcomings of the administration in her first year. The Mayor was 
actively involved in transportation planni ng initiatives during her first year, including 
conversations with Amtrak about establishing rail service on a Dallas to New York line. Amtrak 
is conducting a test run later this month and is in discussions with city leaders on a proposed 
location for a pa ssenger station.  
The public transportation system for Shreveport and 
Bossier City runs bus and A mericans with Disabilities 
Act (ADA)  complementary paratransit service from 
5:00am to 1:30am Monday – Saturday and from 
8:00am to 5:30pm on Sundays. Night ser vice between 
7:00pm and 1:30am is a limited service  that runs on 
routes designed through a public planning 
process in 2007 to align transportation services 
with retail districts and major employers that 
have multiple shifts and extended operating 
hours. The main bus terminal is currently located 
in downtown, but operations will shift to a new 
intermodal transportation facility on the western 
edge of the central business district in 2017 as 
part of a route restructuring plan designed to decrease passenger tr avel times. The city will also 
construct a new southwest Shreveport transfer center this year that will open to coincide with the 
other route changes in 2017, and the Shreveport Regional Airport has been used as a transfer 
point for three bus routes since 2014.   
Investments in technology have helped shape the pending redesign of the public transportation 
system, and they have also made public transit more convenient for citizens who rely on the bus 
system for daily or occasional transportation  in Shreveport  and Bossier City . Feature s such as 
real-time bus tracking by phone, short message service  (SMS), or web and trip planning on 
City of Shreveport  
Smart City Challenge

Google transit help regular riders navigate th eir transportation options. SporTran is exploring 
additional technology to roll out later this year to improve the rider experience, such as mobile 
ticketing and Wi -Fi on the full bus fleet.  
Shreveport has shown a commitment to innovation and investment in the local economy in the 
recent past and city leaders are excited about the potent ial to be an agent of change once again. 
In the transportation sector, Shreveport was the first city in Louisiana to introduce Compressed 
Natural Gas vehicles into its public transportation fleet  as part of a clean fuels initiative adopted 
by city leaders . Leveraging an American Recovery & Reinvestment Act (ARRA ) grant to build 
the CNG fueling infrastructure, the City has purchased CNG buses exclusively since 2010 and 
more than 40% of SporTran buses now run off of natural gas. The city public works departme nt 
has also adopted CNG for 33% of  its garbage  truck fleet , contributing to Shreveport’s incumbent 
status as Municipality of the Year for the Louisiana Clean Fuels awards .  
Admittedly, mobility choices outside of the public 
transportation have been limited in Shreveport, but that is 
changing with a greater emphasis on bicycle 
infrastructure and safety initiatives to bring biking into 
the mainstream. The Bike Shreveport cooperative is an 
example of a citizen -led initiative that shows that th e 
public is taking an active role in the process to improve 
the local transportation system and policy environment. 
The “bike container” in the Shreveport Common district 
serves as a garage for restoration and repair of bicycles 
that are then donated to c ommunity organizations. 
SporTran maintains bike racks on all of its buses, making 
it easy for citizens to jump from one mode to the next, and the new intermodal terminal will 
include linkages with a network of bike paths that has been funded and will be en tering the 
implementation stage this year.  Bike Shreveport also organizes outings and provides information 
to public on recommended routes through their website and social media pages in their efforts to 
put #ButtsOnBikes.  
In the graphic that follows , we p resent a map of our downtown circulator route, one of the 
primary modes for which  we propose to integrate electric, self -driving vehicle technology. Along 
the circulator route, we identify locations where we intend to develo p transportation 
infrastructure.   
These include:  
City of Shreveport

Intermodal Transportation Facility with Electric Vehicle Charging and Parking  – 
This facility is currently under construction and is expected to be completed in early 
2017. The design includes bus lanes for SporTran and bus slips for intercity bus lines. 
Greyhound is expected to be the largest intercity operator in the facility, but we have also 
had indications from Megabus that they plan to bring service to Shreveport at this 
facility. The site has convenient rail and interstate access, and will potentially be 
expanded to house Amtrak. Two on -site parking lots, owned by the city, can be 
integrated into the project plan for installation of charging technology and ICT 
infrastructure.  
Electric Taxi/Circulator Station  – This site is the current bus terminal for Shreveport 
and Bossier City, located in downtown Shreveport. Built in 1986, the iconic tent design 
contributes to citizens’ positive sentiments on the public transit  system and will continue 
to be a prominent feature in the downtown landscape after the planned route restructuring 
in 2017. Transit bus traffic will be significantly reduced once the new intermodal facility 
opens, so there is an opportunity to give new li fe to the station by making it the hub for 
electronic vehicle operations. The facility is already covered, which makes it an attractive 
site for a demonstration project. Proximity to entertainment, the Shreveport farmer’s 
market, and downtown office buildi ngs are also positive features that make taxi service 
from this location highly marketable.   
Vehicle Charging Stations and Information Hub in the Shreveport Common 
Cultural District  – We propose to build electric charging infrastructure in the Shreveport 
Common cultural district to support economic development in the area that was named 
the #1 development project in the nation for 2015 -16 by the National Development 
Council. This arts and culture district is home to the legendary Municipal Auditorium and 
has already seen $40 million in city, parish, and private investment since the launch of 
the project in 2011. On the edge of downtown and adjacent to I -20, this area has ample 
parking to help address the constraint that is hampering downtown development, and  the 
implementation of the downtown circulator will help provide the missing transportation 
element that will make this a viable parking option for commuters.  
Cohab Shreveport -Bossier – While we do not anticipate any infrastructure at Cohab, we 
have includ ed it on the map to show the proximity to other project activities. Cohab is a 
local non -profit that will help lead our efforts to promote data accessibility.  
Other technology featured in our proposal such as connected vehicle technology and data -sharing 
platforms are not presented on the map, but are game -changing ITS solutions that would be 
easily transferred to other cities to address common tra nsportation challenges. These projects are 
explained in further detail in the sections that follow.City of Shreveport  
Smart City Challenge

IV. Detailed Approach to Achieving USDOT Vision  
In this section, we present our approach to implementing USDOT’s vision for a smart city 
through specific interv entions and approaches for each of the 12 high priority and priority vision 
elements identified in the Smart City Challenge.  
Vision Element #1: Urban Automation.  The economics of public transportation are a challenge 
throughout the country. In Shreveport, the cost of labor and benefits is the single biggest cost of 
operating bus and van service at more than 65% of gross operating costs.  Looking past the 
significantly higher capital investment (for now at least), automated vehicles offer an opportunity 
to im prove the efficiency of public transportation and give passengers more control over when 
they want to go. Our first proposed investment  involve s introducing self -driving vans for the  
downtown circulators that will launch as part of the SporTran route syste m restructuring in 2017 . 
Tied to the city’s signal system and incorporated into the development of either wireless or in -
ground technology, an automated electric vehicle  that moved from high demand locations along 
a very basic route would save money, incre ase efficiency, and pave the way for additional 
development over time.   
This approach could also be extended to neighborhood circulators that are designed to keep 
heavy duty transit buses out of residential districts. These routes will connect up with the  main 
fixed route service, serving as collectors for the system. These circulators will be small vans or 
cutaway type shuttles that will operate in areas with a 25 mph maximum speed limit, and thus 
would be ideal test sites for incorporat ing automated vehic les int o public transportation.  ADA 
accessibility and fare collection are challenges for mid -size transit agency with trained operators 
on every vehicle. Moving to fully automated vehicles will raise questions beyond the anticipated 
test of how the vehicle s will perform, but neighborhood circulator routes would provide the right 
environment for assessing both the technology and the approach for integrating automation into 
public transit.  
Another option that we raise is to deploy  electric vehicles for fixed route individual or shared -
ride “taxi” service. Our downtown bus terminal will have available capacity to support this new 
mode along with charging stations for both city -owned vehicles and public use. Initially, vehicles 
may n ot be fully automated, but the goal would be to move to a driverless system in a short 
period of time as the technology is tested and advanced. The system could run either on a fixed 
route structure, or it could accommodate pre -defined route deviations bas ed on passenger 
demand and travel patterns. A potential  pricing model could inversely follow demand, with 
higher prices in the day when more traditional public transit options are available, and lower 
prices at night to encourage use and minimize the need for larger vehicles for transit service.  City of Shreveport  
Smart City Challenge  
Page 14 
 
 
Lastly, a lthough it would require a significan t design 
shift, one of the unique opportunities for automation 
arises in Shreveport from its partnership with Elio 
Motors. Introducing automation into the design 
currently in testing at Elio could allow people to use 
automated vehicles to assist in parking  and mobility in 
the urban core. This could be an  app-based system, tied 
to the c ity’s planned mobile payment application for 
parking and transit, whereby parking or transit patrons 
could access the automated vehicles as shuttles between 
parking and their end destination. This would lead to a decrease in vehicles in congested centers, 
improve ride -share usage, and aid in utilization of high demand – yet random – requests of 
individuals that mass transit finds inefficient to serve. In concept, an individual would access an 
app in the downtown area where parking is exceptionally limited. The app would dispatch a self -
driving vehicle to pick them up and relocate them to a pre -determined parking garage or lot 
outside of the congested central business district.  
Vision Element # 2: Connected Vehicles.  To better coordinate bus movements in a transportation 
system of our size, we have discussed the idea of “Connection Protection ” with technology firms 
and feel that this is a solution that is within reach over the demonstration period of this project. 
In larger systems and on major bus routes, headways between vehicles may be as short as 5 
minutes, so missing a bus occasionally migh t not be a major inconvenience. When you get up to 
headways of 20 -30 minutes though, missing the bus by a minute can be extremely problematic. 
Our AVL system runs off of cellular networks , communicating bus locations back to servers 
every three seconds. Th e system compares this location data to schedule time points and 
maintains a running record of on -time performance. Currently, this schedule is communicated to 
passengers to help them track a single bus, but there is a potential to make buses talk to each 
other through the on -board mobile data terminals so that bus operators can wait for connecting 
passengers if they know they will be arriving shortly.  Once developed in Shreveport, this is a 
system that would reach scale quickly as an add -on feature to real -time passenger information 
systems already deployed in a growing number of transit systems.  
 
On-bus technology can support transit efficiency, but there is also an opportunity to use transit as 
part of a data collection network with broader planning and t raffic engineering utility. Installing 
dedicated short -range communications (DSRC ) technology  on the City’s fixed route buses and 
LiftLine  paratransit vans could take advantage of the fact that city assets are already racking up 
millions of miles a year on  the city’s roadway network. Adding in police and fire vehicles, public 
works trucks, parks department vehicles, and other city vehicles could create a mesh network of 
real time data collection throughout the city. Currently SporTran has some on -board data

collection systems that communicate in real time over cellular networks and other systems that 
dump data through a wireless bridge at the main yard, so depending on how quickly data is 
needed, the cost of collecting and transmitting the data can be fairly  insignificant.  
 
Mobileye’s support to this challenge brings an additional level of connected vehicles, 
emphasizing safety as a benefit of connected vehicle technology. SporTran  already coordinates 
with police, engineering, and public works on trouble spot s in the route structure, but having 
real-time quantifiable data would provide a much more powerful tool for planning and for risk 
mitigation efforts. One additional on -vehicle technology we would like to explore would be 
transmitters or communication modu les that could help reduce the risk of vehicles rear -ending 
buses at bus stops. Building protected bus stops throughout the city is cost prohibitive, but 
beyond safety lighting, we propose to explore additional approaches to minimizing the injuries, 
transi t delays, and vehicle down time that are caused by accidents that should be preventable 
given technology that is available today.  
 
Looking at the transportation system as a whole, t he Shreveport -Bossier area presently maintains 
a fiber optic communication  ring. This system allows for intelligent transportation element s 
previously deployed to work together and communicate with the municipalities and the Traffic 
Management Center. One concept considered by the region is to utilize this network to install 
stations that would allow equipped vehicles to receive real -time data on major routes and 
freeways in the region.  This would allow motorists to receive travel data on excessive delay, 
accidents, or events impacting traffic at a regional level; giving them the  opportunity to choose 
alternate routes. The net result is lower congestion, fewer heavy vehicles involved in incidents, 
lower secondary incident rates, and fewer emissions.  Informed drivers would also have 
information needed to select routes that avoid co nstruction zones , special events , accidents, and 
trains  (or conversely reach the special event safely & efficiently). With two way communication, 
the vehicles would provide the system with travel data, congestion levels, and alert authorities 
the moment an  incident occurs.  
 
In addition to its fiber network, Shreveport is in the early stages of installing a  supervisory 
control and data acquisitio n (SCADA ) system. This is a wireless network tied to its water 
distribution and data collection system. An addition to this system could allow for vehicles to 
access data and provide data through communication across the internet. Enabled vehicles would 
then give d ata on local streets and receive similar information on local roadways in addition to 
principal routes and freeways. We will explore linking camera systems on buses into this 
network for live streaming in emergency situations as a first stage of testing th e capabilities of 
the system. There are many more, much lower bandwidth solutions that could also benefit from City of Shreveport  
Smart City Challenge  
Page 16 
 
 
this citywide networ k, and the incremental cost of adding capacity is minimal compared to the 
capital investment the city has already made.  
 
Vision Element #3: Intelligent, Sensor -Based Infrastructure.  A communication network is key to 
receiving and disseminating information. However, data collection remains the underpinning of 
such a process.  Communication systems easily detect data from equipped vehicles, however, 
they do not collect data from unequipped vehicles. One method of bringing more vehicles into a 
connected system is to employ devices such as 3M’s Blue Toad to track cell phone signals. This 
is not an inexpensive endeavor, but as citizens  become more accepting of crowdsourcing 
approaches, individualized data will become increasingly available for planning and investment 
prioritization. Shreveport envisions a rollout of multiple mobile applications  of this nature to 
capture the presence of these devices without capturing the details associated. Once processed, 
this data can be turned into data collection for various efforts:  
 Daily Traffic Counts  
 Congestion Data  
 Travel Time  
 Routing  
Additionally, m ultiple signals throughout the city  currently  rely on video and induction loop 
detection for signal actuation. With available technology, this data can also be collected to 
provide long term data needed for planning, improvements, and in identifying problem locations. 
Armed with this level of data, c ity planners and engineers can focus efforts and limited funding 
efficiently and fairly.  Maybe more importantly however, this data can be made available to the 
public to foster new and innovative approaches to  how traffic information is used.  
 
We also hav e an opportunity to capitalize on the investments we have made in traffic signal 
prioritization to expand the functionality of that system.  We propose to fund installation of TSP 
technology on transit vehicles as part of this project to improve on -time per formance for the fleet 
but also to capture additional data on how our transportation system is performing. Monitoring 
the frequency of TSP interventions for public transportation will provide insight into traffic 
flows and schedule/route flaws that are cur rently difficult to quantify and analyze. We anticipate 
that there will be other non -transit uses for this type of data as well that we can expand on 
through collaboration with stakeholders and technology partners.    
 
Vision Element #4: Urban Analytics. Connected vehicle technology, social networking, 
crowdsourcing, and other developments are generating massive amounts of data, but the truth is 
we are not coming close to using existing data to its full potential. This element is closely tied to 
the issue of architecture and standards, and cities face the challenge of cost effectively City of Shreveport  
Smart City Challenge  
Page 17 
 
 
developing systems that and tools that can leverage 
data from multiple sources. Our proposed “Civic 
Communications” project  is a fairly simple example of 
an urban analytics an d reporting system, but even this 
will require collaboration a nd coordination between 
vendors who may see this type of initiative as a threat 
to their business. The shift to a Software as a Service  
(SaaS) model and less reliance on hardware sales in 
the ITS industry however may reduce some of the 
barriers that previo usly existed with attempts to 
integrate solutions in a common platform.  
 
“Civic Communications” could be a good test model for this type of centr al data analysis, 
starting as a platform for city departments, but eventually expanding to allow for public 
participation through mobile applications. For example, our AVL provider could easily configure 
a menu on bus mobile data terminals to create a mech anism  for bus operators to report on events 
that could be exported in real time to a data analytics platform. Or in its current form, raw data 
on transit vehicle movements and passenger loads is already available for integration into this 
type of system. Other departments within the city already have their own hardware and systems 
designed to support their operations, so having them invest in mobile data terminals to match the 
bus fleet would not make senses. The system would therefore rely on the ability o f different 
technology providers to adapt their products to contribute with the broader needs of the 
city/client.  
 
Vision Element # 5: User -Focused Mobility Services and Choices. The changes that the City of 
Shreveport has been implementing to its public tr ansportation system are designed to improve 
mobility for citizens who count on SporTran buses to get to work, school, church, grocery stores, 
and other places in town that are important to their lives and livelihoods. We have highlighted 
the changes we are  making to bus service, including the launch of a real -time bus tracking 
system in 2014, but we have been equally aggressive in implementing new technology for our 
LiftLine paratransit service. Since 2012, ridership for this door -to-door ADA service has 
increased from 35,000 trips to almost 60,000 trips per year. Technology has made this growth 
possible, starting with implementation of a new scheduling system on installation of tablets on 
vehicles to provide drivers with directions and real -time manifest up dates. As stated earlier 
though, our goal as a city is to provide more services to a greater segment of the population, and 
public transportation is only part of the equation.  
 
Livability Scorecard  
 
What makes Shreveport a great place 
to call home? For starters, it’s easy to 
get around. That is a selling point to 
businesses looking to relocate to the 
area, but like many quality of life 
indicators, it is largely ane cdotal. 
Making data on congestion and travel 
time more available and accessible 
could help mid -sized cities measure 
and improve on the indicators that 
make them attractive in today’s 
business environment.  City of Shreveport  
Smart City Challenge  
Page 18 
 
 
One project that is in the design stage is a joint parking and transit mobile p ayment system. 
Ideally, citizens will be able to use a common mobile app to pay for these services and use the 
same system to access bus arrival information and parking availability data. For people parking 
along the circulator route to access downtown, on e application will allow them to find either a 
paid parking or free spot, pay for their parking if it is in a pay zone, and gauge how long they 
will wait for the next circulator to pass by.  
 
Mobility services are evolving, and local policies and legislativ e frameworks are being 
challenged to keep up. Shreveport has shown the commitment to adjusting local ordinances to 
support and nurture new transportation solutions. In 2012, the City Council adopted an ordinance 
amendment to allow for iShuttle, a  mobility on demand start -up service to enter into the market. 
The city is currently finalizing arrangements with Uber begin operations in Shreveport, and is 
excited about how this will create a more expansive transportation network. Bike share programs 
have not yet  caught on in Shreveport in the way that they have in larger metropolitan areas, 
however, our locally developed solution Bike Shreveport is a cooperative that is refurbishing and 
donating bikes to generate interest in biking as a viable mode of transportat ion in the city. The 
Bike Shreveport movement has also helped secure funding the Transportation Alternatives 
Program to create a network of bike lanes to improve bike safety in and around downtown.  
 
Vision Element # 6: Urban Delivery and Logistics. As with  many of the other vision elements, 
our approach to urban delivery and logistics starts with identifying solutions that will initially 
support public transit operations, but that will ultimately have an impact on the transportation 
system that will benefit  all users, including private supply chain operations. Currently, the main 
conflict between freight and public transportation is the lack of actionable, real -time data related 
to railroad crossings. Working with our AVL /Computer -Aided Dispatch  provider and  the 
regional TMC, we propose to develop a system whereby dispatchers are notified of train 
movements are able to instruct bus operators to initiate detours via the onboard MDT. We 
envision that this system would also push alerts out to passengers to reduc e the risk of detours 
resulting in passengers being bypassed.   
 
Vision Element # 7: Strategic Business Models and Partnering Opportunities.  Our approach for 
this vision element is to prioritize making data available to both public and private sector clients 
and promoting the availability of data to private technology developers to help stimulate ideas 
for new applications and technology. The City  has an application program interface  (API) for 
bus location data that can be made readily available for private developers, but promoting the 
availability of this and data collected through other ITS systems is a low cost way to elevate 
Shreveport as a te sting ground for transportation technology. Shreveport -Bossier is home to the 
Cyber Innovation Center, Intertech Science Park, and a number of locally grown, national City of Shreveport  
Smart City Challenge  
Page 19 
 
 
software development companies such as Praeses, Bowman Systems, and Twin Engines Lab, 
and these partners have the capacity to lead or support innovations taking place in the 
transportation sector if they are given a platform to make them competitive in this industry.   
 
One way that we propose to involve the local business 
community is through the Cohab entrepreneur 
development programs. Cohab , a local non -profit that 
provides shared office and meeting space and hosts 
training courses for area businesses,  would be an ideal 
home for a repository of data feeds as their interactions 
with start -ups and more advanced “mentor” firms  would 
build awareness about the types of da ta that are 
available. Typi cally, city governments house these types 
of repositories internally as a protective mechanism, but 
this does not promote the maximum use of the data. We 
are not proposing that Cohab would maintain servers, rather, they could simply add a page on 
their web site that links directly to data sources that are maintained elsewhere. This approach 
woul d also provide government with a feedback mechanism about what types of data the private 
sector need s as Cohab would be part of the steering committee assessing what data could be 
made available and at what cost.  
 
Vision Element # 8: Smart Grid, Roadway Electrification, and Electric Vehicles.  To complement  
our proposed electric automated downtown circulator shuttle  and taxi services , our vision 
includes  building public charging station s in both the new intermodal terminal and the downtown 
transfer hub as well as in the Shreveport Common district along with circulator route . The 
charging station will support the circulator vehicles  and taxis , but will also catalyze effort s to get 
commuters to park outside of the central business district and use the circulator as last mile 
transportation. SWEPCO, the electric provider for Shreveport, would be a key partner in this 
effort, along with the vehicle and charging system manufact urers. Shreveport has been a leader 
in clean fuel initiatives with CNG, and we welcome this opportunity to diversify our clean 
technology efforts through electric vehicle technology.  
Vision Element # 9: Connected, Involved Citizens . As the city releases new  mobile applications 
such as mobile payment apps for transit and parking, there are new opportunities to get data 
feedback from citizens that can contribute to planning . We commit to involving the public in the 
technology that we plan to deploy through this challenge, because ultimately the infrastructure in 
Shreveport is there to serve our citizens. We have discussed the idea of an enterprise system to 
centralize data c ollection from various city departments, but thinking bigger, this system could 
also incorporate a mechanism to pull in data from citizens. The city website includes a complaint 
If You Build It…  
 
Building a repository of transportation 
data feeds can help stimulate tech 
growth, but it can also take the ITS 
investment burden off of the public 
sector. For example, property 
developers might be willing to 
purchase traffic information displays 
to put at the exits of housing 
developments if technology 
compan ies were able to access traffic 
data and tailor it to client locations.  City of Shreveport  
Smart City Challenge  
Page 20 
 
 
portal that allows citizens to submit inquiries or complaints and track the re solution of their 
issue. This is an extremely customer -friendly tool; however, adding functionality to allow users 
to geotag incidents using location services on their phones could improve the city’s ability to 
track and resolve issues.   
     
Vision Elemen t #10: Architecture and Standards . This is a vision element where USDOT’s 
expertise and experience will greatly contribute to project design and efforts to replicate 
successes from the demonstration projects . In negotiating with vendors and partners, we 
recognize that we will have to take a firm stand on architecture and standards that will align with 
the principals of promoting a sharing economy.  
 
Vision Element # 11: Low-Cost, Efficient , Secure, and Resilient Information and Communications 
Technology (I CT). ICT is at the center of almost all of the interventions proposed in our vision, 
and we share USDOT’s view that system design must be approached with fail safe mechanisms 
and redundancies built in so that failures do not have catastrophic impacts on city  operations and 
transportation systems. The City of Shreveport updates its business resumption plan annually 
through a process whereby department heads meet and talk through new challenges and 
additional technology that must be reflected in the p lan. Shrev eport takes this plan seriously and 
makes it an active, living document because we understand that any downtime of city systems 
negatively impacts citizens, costs the city money, and undermines the reputation of city leaders.  
 
The vehicles and electric gri d infrastructure we are proposing will require significant capital 
investments, but the ICT solutions are much lower cost interventions that have the potential to 
impact our city as much as or more than these elements. We maintain separate servers for most  
ICT applications in use in our transportation network, either on site or through Software as a 
Service  vendors, but linking these back to an enterprise system to strengthen our urban analytics 
capabilities will be the next phase of integrating these data sets to expand on the potential uses 
for the data that we are collecting and will begin collecting through connected vehicle 
technology and sensor -based infrastructure.   
 
Adopting new technology brings new risks, and data security is a real concern for the city and 
our citizens. As we bring on new tools such as mobile payment technology for public transit and 
parking, we will also create powerful data sets that provide grea ter insights into customer 
behavior and travel patterns than current farebox and automated passenger counter systems 
generate. Security standards for financial transactions provide a strong framework for how this 
data is shared, but as we roll out other te chnology that is not linked to financial transactions, 
emphasizing standards that protect Personal Identifiable Information (PII) will be key to creating 
systems that are replicable and scalable.  City of Shreveport  
Smart City Challenge  
Page 21 
 
 
 
Vision Element # 12: Smart Land Use. Our project focuses on the downtown area to complement 
other ongoing efforts to re -establish the urban core. Shreveport is very much a typical mid -sized 
city with sprawl and expansion to the suburbs, but there is a growing understanding that this 
approach to development is unsus tainable given the strain that it puts on the budget for upkeep 
and maintenance of the associated infrastructure network. Over the past five years, private 
developers have repurposed historic buildings to construct five new apartment and condominium 
comple xes, and three additional large scale mixed -use developments are in the planning and 
construction phase. Shreveport and Caddo Parish have also drafted a new unified development 
code (UDC) to replace outdated zoning ordinances and promote smarter land use a nd investment 
moving forward. The UDC is currently available for public comment and is expected to be 
adopted by the middle of 2016.  
 
 
V. Project Risks and Risk Mitigation Strategies  
Cutting edge technology and innovation undoubtedly involve some level of risk. However, 
without a forward focus, it groups can easily miss out on opportunities to develop concepts that 
the nation desperately needs to improve. Self -driving vehicles, electri c vehicle innovations, and 
mass transit inventions fit this category. Despite the risks involved in such undertaking, the 
benefits from success overcome the negative impact of doing nothing or failing to move forward.  
The classification of this challenge as a research projects supports the notion that there are 
significant risks with new technology, but identifying the right test sites in the right city is the 
primary risk mitigation approach for this initiative. We believe that the projects that we are 
proposing will not be disruptive to the transportation system  or to public transportation in 
Shreveport;  rather , they are projects that will complement and expand on the systems already in 
place.  
While there is risk in some of Shreveport’s proposal, there ar e sections that are extremely low 
risk factors. A combined effort in such a setting virtually guarantees that a level of improvement 
will be achieved. Even in areas that may not see immediate success, the platform will be in place 
for future efforts and ca n serve as a learning experience for others to build on.  Some of the 
efforts being considered in this initiative are based on solid, t ried and true technology. Mass 
transit priority at signals and e mergency vehicle preemption  are based on proven technolog y and 
programs that can be easily implemented with exceptional results once funding is secured. These 
concepts will provide outstanding, easily discernable results with minimum risk. However these 
key elements are only part of the vision in Shreveport.  City of Shreveport  
Smart City Challenge  
Page 22 
 
 
A risk that is specific to the Shreveport proposal is that the emphasis we are placing on the public 
transportation system . This focus may deter other local stakeholders from getting involved in the 
effort  if we are unable to effectively communicate how the p roject will reach a much broader 
segment of the population than public transportation has traditionally served . This is a low risk ; 
however, as there is widespread interest in the changes that have been taking place with public 
transit and city support from a financial perspective remains strong. Additionally , the 
commitment of the mayor and local leadership to this project will ensur e that this project secures  
cross -sector involvement at the city, parish, and state government level as the benefit to the 
region of being selected for this project would have far reaching effects.  
Lastly, there is a policy risk associated with the project  for Shreveport as there would be for any 
City. New technology does not always fit with existing legislation and ordinances, so there must 
be a willingness of leaders and the public to adapt local laws to allow for change. Shreveport’s 
City Council has sho wed this willingness, including in the transportation sector with legislation 
in 2012 to update the rules and regulations that governed taxi and limousine services to allow for 
an on -demand mobile app -based service to enter the market. Additionally, the Ci ty Attorney for 
Shreveport has extensive experience with technology contracts and data rights issues and is a 
firm believer in crafting ITC contracts that are forward -looking will allow the city to make the 
most of its investments by allowing for interoper ability increased in the future.   
  
VI. Partnering for Success  
Our project team will be led by city employees from public transportation and engineering, but 
will be guided by a steering committee of stakeholders from USDOT, existing vendors, new 
technology pa rtners, local universities, the local business community and users of public 
transportation alternatives. As stated in Section II.B. above, we feel that it is too early to commit 
to specific partners outside of our local team, in large part because being s elected as a finalist 
will open new doors and create new partnership  opportunities that are less viable at this stage in 
the solicitation process. We have a number of local universities that we will involve in the 
project at different levels, including for  monitoring and evaluation activities, but we want to 
work with the most advanced technologies available, which will require collaboration with a 
number of new partners and research institutions with which we do not currently have 
established relationships . 
 
The City of Shreveport’s role will be to present our challenges and facilitate an environment in 
which these new partners can test jointly developed solutions. We want outside help, but we will 
be actively involved in all aspects of implementation to ma ke sure that projects and activities fit 
with our long -term goals for a livable Shreveport. We will assign a project manager for each City of Shreveport  
Smart City Challenge  
Page 23 
 
 
intervention to oversee the work plan elements and take the lead on monitoring and evaluation 
for that intervention. The p roject manager will be responsible for coordinating the activities of 
sub-partners, and will report back to the steering committee so that interventions are not 
implemented in isolation, but rather they remain part of an overall vision for system wide 
impr ovements for the city and transportation network.  
 
VII. Overview of Existing Transportation Infrastructure  
As described above, Shreveport has a sufficient  roadway system with 51.70 miles  of interstate, 
68.87 miles  of principle arterial roads, and 121.5 miles o f minor arterials. The Shreveport -
Bossier r egion maintains a fiber optic network on its freeways and several of its most traveled 
roadways. Adequate capacity exists to employ this network as it was installed with the intent of 
expansion.  Additionally, t he Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development 
maintains a regional TMC  that is staffed at all times. Devices such as variable message signs, fog 
warning systems, video surveillance, motorist assistance patrol, and modern traffic signal 
systems hav e already been employed within the region.   
 
SporTran  provides fixed route service on 14 daytime routes and four night routes in Shreveport. 
An additional four daytime routes and two night routes provide connections in Bossier City. The 
main bus terminal is located in the central business district with the Sh reveport Regional Airport 
serving as a transfer center on the west side of town. SporTran also provides paratransit service 
throughout the city limits of Shreveport and Bossier. In 2015, SporTran ran 2.25 million vehicle 
revenue miles and provided more tha n 2.75 million passenger trips. We have expanded three 
routes for 2016, but will implement a major route restructuring in 2017 with the opening of a 
new intermodal terminal and construction of a new transfer center in Southwest Shreveport.  
 
Since 2010, SporTran has aggressively introduced new technology and continues to add features 
focused on data collection and analysis and passenger amenities. System changes include : 
 Fuel diversification through addition of 25 Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) fixed route 
and paratransit vehicles  
 Installation of bike racks on all fixed route vehicles   
 Real Time Passenger Information System ( www.sportranbus.com ) 
 Installation of Automated Passenger Counters  
 Implementation of Automati c Vehicle Locator/Computer -Aided Dispatch  
 Upgraded on -vehicle camera systems  
SporTran is also currently working on a solicitation for a pay -by-phone mobile payment system 
for transit with a link to a pay -by-phone downtown parking app. This technology aims  to City of Shreveport  
Smart City Challenge  
Page 24 
 
 
improve the ridership experience and promote mode choice by linking with other transportation 
systems.  
 
VIII. Overview of Current Data Collection Systems  
In presenting our ideas for new interventions, we have highlighted some of the technology that is 
curre ntly in use for data collection in Shreveport. We also do quite a bit of manual data 
collection that is cumbersome to capture and integrate into enterprise systems. We hope to 
fundamentally change our data collection systems through this challenge and demo nstrate that 
major change can be accomplished with investments that are affordable to most mid -sized cities. 
Getting the approach right and testing different models is an expense that Shreveport cannot bear 
alone though, but the Smart City Challenge provid es a platform for helping Shreveport and other 
mid-sized cities develop workable solutions to typical data collection challenges.  
We currently collect data through a number of automated systems and manual approaches, 
specific to the needs of various depar tments. Analysts in Shreveport’s t raffic engineering 
division utilize counting devices to collect daily traffic counts. They also manually collect 
turning movement, speed, and classification data as needed for projects or requests. This data is 
shared with  all agencies in need throughout the region. Additionally, counts are updated annually 
and shared on the internet for historical and current analysis.  One of the advantages to future 
efforts will be the automation of much of this data. What is presently be ing collected manually, 
can instead be automated. This increases the reliability and accuracy of the data. Sharing the data 
becomes a matter of uploading a file  or automating data integration  instead of the lengthy 
process of data entry, pr ocessing, and ev entual upload.  
On the transit side, we collect data on typical transportation indicators such as ridershi p, revenue, 
and on -time performance . We have been using automated data collection systems for years 
through on -board electronic fareboxes, but we only recently replaced manual data collection 
systems for many of our indicators through implementation of our automatic vehicle locator and 
automated passenger counter systems. This automation has allowed us to make more informed 
decisions about route changes,  bus stop locations, transit amenity (benches and shelters) projects 
and other aspects of how we operate so that we can become more efficient as a city.  
With a modern system, raw data once collected by individual divisions  (e.g. transit, public 
works, and engineering)  and processed for their own uses becomes available for use by anyone 
with a need. Unprocessed data serves as a foundation that others can build upon instead of the 
filtered counterpart that may not fit the needs of other entities. We have prop osed a “Civic 
Communications” enterprise system as an example of way to collect and disseminate data to a 
range of stakeholders, without requiring new investments in hardware and department -level 
infrastructure.  City of Shreveport  
Smart City Challenge  
Page 25 
 
 
From a regional ITS perspective, a  good deg ree of integration  presently exists between the 
multiple agencies in the region  and regional data feeds into the Long Range Transportation Plan 
process at the project prioritization level . However, most data is  not presently in a format that is 
useable by the various groups , so coordination with the state and other stakeholders will be an 
important part of our approach to introducing new ITS systems, a process that is currently 
managed through the metropolitan planning organization (MPO). On this note, b oth the City of 
Bossier and the City of Shreveport have contracts with the Louisiana Department of 
Transportation to share data and perform studies. These City/State agreements give the 
framework for sharing of traffic data collected and used to answer a vari ety of requests: new 
roads, problem areas, signal issues, speed issues, etc.  
 
IX. Performance Monitoring and Impact Evaluation  
Our performance monitoring plan (PMP) will include goals, objectives and indicators at the 
project level, and also for individual vision elements so that we can test the effectiveness of 
activities and show how the vision elements contribute to overarching  performance measures that 
show an increasingly efficient and effective transportation system.  Our project steering 
committee will develop a full set of goals and objectives during the design phase , but we have 
established  the set of principles below  that guide our proposed interventions . 
 Through the Smart City Challenge, we aim to:  
 Identify solutions that will ultimately strengthen the city’s financial position through 
improved operational efficiency and economic growth  
 Set a new standard for safe transpo rtation infrastructure through connected vehicle 
technology and vehicle automation  
 Leverage efforts of individual departments and stakeholders to unleash the potential of 
our ICT investments  
The indicators that we will use to measure project impacts will r eflect the needs of all of our 
stakeholders. For transit, project activities such as “Connection Protection” and the launch of 
automated circulators should increase public transportation ridership, but we will go deeper in 
analyzing the impacts to look at the cost -benefit and other effects of these types of interventions. 
For example, the Downtown Development Authority (DDA) tracks office space occupancy as a 
critical indicator of economic performance. We envision that improved downtown transportation 
syste ms will have a significant impact on this indicator, and will explore this through 
independent evaluation to depict the full impact of transportation investments on our city.  City of Shreveport  
Smart City Challenge  
Page 26 
 
 
Public safety is an area where benchmark data is widely available in Shreveport a nd around the 
country  and is an area  where there is significant potential to make improvements using the smart 
technology proposed in our vision and in the USDOT ITS Strategic Plan framework. Connected 
vehicle technology such as the Mobileye solutions that  are already commercially available will 
help cut down on accidents and loss of life, which has an enormous and easily calculated cost 
benefit for cities.  Promoting mode choice and introducing more accessible mobility options can 
also significantly benefit  Shreveport, and our M&E approach will attempt to tell this complete 
story by incorporating indicators that are important to all stake holders, such as a reduction in 
drunk driving that may be attributable to the proposed automated taxi service.  
Involvemen t of university and research partners will help assess more complicated indicators as 
attribution will be a challenge given the variables that come into play with transportation and 
development. For example, current gas prices are negatively impacting publ ic transportation 
usage, but the model for measuring elasticity of demand for transit is outdated, especially in mid -
sized cities where fuel prices make up a greater share of the overall cost of transportation than in 
larger urban settings where parking an d tolls influence decisions on mode choice.    
 
X. Organizational Capacity  
The City of Shreveport manages a large portfolio of capital projects and federal grant programs 
across sectors, including projects funded through the Federal Aviation Administration, F ederal 
Highway Administration, the Federal Transit Administration, and the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development. To implement these projects, we rely on sound purchasing and 
financial systems, a coordinated approach to risk management, a proactive C ity Attorney’s 
office, and leadership that is committed to providing technical and financial support.  
 
Our p ublic transit system stands out for the  leadership role  it plays  in defining public 
transportation policy for the state and region. The SporTran General  Manager currently serves as 
President of the Louisiana Public Transit Association and is the Secretary/Treasurer for the 
South West Transit Association that covers nin e states, including Louisiana, Texas, Arizona, 
Colorado and Oklahoma.  Staffed with federal purchasing, safety, grants, and M&E specialists, 
SporTran has the departmental resources necessary to lead this program and coordinate multi -
stakeholder activities e nvisioned in our submittal.  
 
Lastly, t he City of Shreveport is committed to identifying opportunities for public -private 
partnerships and to bringing local funds to the table to implement projects identified in this 
proposal and to expand on them after the  USDOT demonstration phase ends. We presently ha ve 
money identified from  our 2011 bond issue set aside for similar projects , such as the $2.4 TSP City of Shreveport  
Smart City Challenge  
Page 27 
 
 
investment we referenced above that will focus on the King’s Highway corridor which is an area 
where we will l aunch expanded bus service in 2017 . While  these local investments represent 
only a small share of the request associated with the  Smart City Challenge projects, they  stand as 
a commitment by Shreveport to see these types of projects through to completion.  
We present letters of support from local partners on the pages that follow to demonstrate that 
community partners are actively involved in city efforts to upgrade technology and systems that 
will serve as the foundation for a more dynamic Shreveport in th e future. We are excited about 
this opportunity and appreciate USDOT’s creative approach to tacking the transportation 
challenges of the future.

 Connected Transportation Innovation 
Platform – Spokane, WA  
Part I  - Vision Narrative  
1) Primary Vision   
 
Spokane is a place where miraculous feats of ingenuity have repeatedly created urban innovations that 
have durably transformed our community, sti mulated our economy and further increased the quality of life 
for our citizens . Spokane has aligned behind the continuity of leadership making Spokane a safer, stronger, 
smarter city of choice. The building blocks are in place,  the partnerships are formed and the vision is clear.  
Spokane proposes a transportation innovation proving ground where, in different measures,  all twelve  of 
the US D epartment of Transportation’s Beyond Traffic  vision elements will be addressed in a unique 
environment for mobilizing new concepts by researching and analyzing integrated models, testing and 
refining outcomes and producing prototypes  for scaling to larger, more complex  urban environments . 
Spokane proposes a building and testing platform which enables cities  with c omplex transportation issues  
to capitalize on existing assets a nd grow in a manner that prevents the pervasive critical issues facing citie s 
while achieving the primary aspiration to achieve an increasingly livable com munity . The opportunity to 
demonstrate outcomes in Spokane is relevant to all American cities where we must capitalize on our 
existing assets as we make new investments, taking care to avoid negative unintended consequences.  
Our objective is to combine smart city solutions  at manageable scale  to create measurable impact while 
reducing costs associated with both deployment and operations  - and in a way  that is always people-
centered. The ultimate goal is to make more vibrant, healthy and productive communit ies. Rather than 
pursuing  a singular solution,  we take an overall systems approach focusing on the opportunities of 
multidimensional change that will unlock the potential of our cit y’s existing assets.  We concentrate on a 
leveraging the emerging rich data environment for managing existing resources, thus acknowledging the 
immense infrastructure that exists in the legacy of our industrial cities.  We recognize that a doption of the 
very best, most cutting edge transportation technologies will fail if there is  not thoughtful consideration 
given to the infrastructure  of our existing cities as well as  the equally pressing challenges of equity, 
inclusivity, and reduction of disparities in how people experience their city.  
Spokane’s Smart City Challenge proposal holds electrification of the transportation sector as i ts initial 
leverage point, but additionally embraces the people, policy and regulatory factors that holistically shape 
the modern urban landscape.  Our holistic approach aims to empower cities to leverage their existing 
infrastructure and data assets with t he infrastructure and data assets of others to achieve the best possible 
outcomes for current and future residents.  
Social science outcomes with be documented and studied equally with “engineering” outcomes in Spokane. The outcomes of each vision element i mplementation will be meticulously documented and published as  
Spokane’s proving ground is designed in close collaboration with,  and as a magnet for , principal USDOT Smart City Challenge -  Spokane  
Page 2 of 27 
 investigators practicing in the multiple  higher education institutions , hospi tals, health distri ct, non -profit  and 
private industry  partners . This research environment is already contributing to the multi -faceted discourse 
related to intelligent cities everywhere and the vanguard of new transportation technologies.  
Our integrated, community -wide approach will demonstrate that transportation decisions not only im pact 
how we move in cites, rather  how those  transportation decisions shape  what type of city we get to move in. 
We believe our approach will elevate the topic of transportation in relation to urban form as well as  
encourage a broader realization that how we shape our cities has a direct impact on how they shape us.  
Why Spokane?  
Spokane is a uniquely  positioned mid- sized city for the proposed proving ground. Isolated from the 
influences of adjacent  large urban areas and serving as  the regional center for medical, banking, 
transportation/logistics, manufacturing, education and culture for an Inland Northwest geography ser ving 
more than 2 million people.  Spokane is representative of the population shift f rom rural to urban areas 
defining many American cities. A trend that will surely increase in the coming decades. This movement will 
both elevate the problems and the promise of “our  cities ”.  This is a local and global reality. Our system 
approach is thus considerate of the compounding importance of addressing the pending sociological, geographic, environmental, and public health issues, as a well as transportation issues of our increasing urbanization.  Our historically unprecedented migration to cities is ex pected to intensify during the next few 
decades, requiring leading practices that can shape our rapidly transforming urban fabric, let alone respond to our current (transportation) challenges.  
Spokane’s culture is balanced by a healthy tension between progressive and conservative politics, an 
urban culture and a farmer’s work ethic . Our city is the result of and our community is characterized by  a 
pione er spirit exemplified by neighbor -helping- neighbor and a deep and generous compassion  for one 
another. In the business  culture arena, Spokane enjoys a well -educated, hard- working workforce and a 
fiscally responsible track record that makes the most capital efficient investments  and understands how to 
bootstrap grand initiatives . The Smart City Challenge propos al we offer bears out these values. The US 
Department of Transportation and Vulcan Foundation dollars invested in Spokane will go farther toward the goals of Beyond Traffic 2045 than possible in any other mid- sized city.  
Our history demonstrates the unique  ways that we have succeeded locally and at a global scale.  
In 1974,  for example,  with tenacious, visionary leadership and heroic  public and private collaboration, 
Spokane became the smallest city ever to host a World’s Fair. On a global stage,  Spokane was the first city  
ever to host a World’s Fair  with an environmental theme. In many ways economically,  physically and 
culturally this event shaped the modern  destiny of Spokane. Next a local 1976 Olympics marathon runner 
capitalized on the revitalization by organizing what has become known as Bloomsday . In just under six 
months, the first event was conceived, organized, financed and presented by volunteers  with over 1000 
runners participating. The event quickly grew to become the largest timed road race in the world peaking at 
61,000 finishers and consistently reporting over 40,000 finishers every year. The event is still run by 
volunteers and was one of the first to employ RFID timing chips in 2006. From our hosting of consecutive 
Winston West NASCAR  road races thorough the Downtown Spokane Core (100 laps of a 1.65 mile course)  
during the July 4
th weekend s in 1987- 88 to the world’s largest  3-on-3 basketball tournament  with more than  
27,000 participants,  7,000 teams, 450 courts  spanning 40- plus downtown city blocks and attracting a crowd USDOT Smart City Challenge -  Spokane  
Page 3 of 27 
 of over 250,000 every year.  Spokane is the place where we do the unexpected, the difficult to achieve.  We 
are able to think big, start small and move fast.  
Moreover, our community has always been able to coalesce behind leaders demonstrating the community’s 
interests and has been convincing in attracting outside investment by honing a shared vision, teaming up to 
accomplish more and by speaking with a unified voice.  In the 1990s, community leaders came together 
under the banner of “Momentum” to rejuvenate the regional economy. They saved Spokane’s economy and preserved a vibrant downtown core during a time when many downtown cores were being abandoned as 
retailers and consumers flocked to suburban malls.  
Twelve years ago, more th an 350 members of the community established a shared vision and created a 
master plan to revitalize a 770 acre plot of land that once hosted a rail yard and municipal waste disposal. The property, along the Spokane River and adjacent to our downtown core, has been transformed into Spokane’s University District -- home to six higher -education institutions.   
Now,  Washington State University  Spokane  is establishing  the first new public medical school in 
Washington since 1917 with an historic broad base of supp ort as they are addressing the critical shortage 
of primary care physicians in Washington and nationally . New students are scheduled to be admitted fall of 
2017 and the effort complements the fact that life sciences  and services  comprise nearly 40% of the 
regional economy.  Spokane currently has the fastest growing health sciences campus in North America.  
Spokane has all the building blocks for creating a robust medical education and research center including our state’s two largest public universities commi tted to expanding in Spokane -  WSU Spokane’s health 
sciences and research focused campus with plans underway to create an independently accredited four -
year medical school and the expansion of the existing Spokane- based University of Washington School of 
Medicine’s WWAMI four -year medical school program that ranks #1 in primary care and rural education. 
Building on the collaborative system of strong health sciences and allied health programs of our regional universities and community colleges with the nationally -recognized, regional -community based healthcare 
system, the foundation is set for continuing to engage business and community leadership in the advocacy and support of the expansion of world- class medical education and other health sciences careers  in 
Spokane.  
Residents of the region live and work as partners at the intersection of urban and rural; land and water; all modes of transportation; as well as manufacturing, service and knowledge economies working together. 
Success for Spokane’s Connected T ransportation Innovation Platform submitted to  the US DOT Smart City 
Challenge comes from taking advantage of these connections and unique assets as a regional center to 
build a  smart + connected, healthy,  mobile and sustainable future.  
Few regions offer Spokane’s combination of focused strengths in high- demand sectors — healthcare-
biosciences, aerospace, clean technology, energy efficiency, IT and digital services — with the unparalleled 
quality of life it takes to grow and retain a talented workforce and productive businesses for the long term.  
Environment  
o Diverse land uses ranging from urban centers to local food production to wild and scenic recreation - all in close proximity  
o A river running through the heart of downtown Spokane and the region that brings power, beauty, 
and clean drinking water through its interconnection with our unique sole- source aquifer  USDOT Smart City Challenge -  Spokane  
Page 4 of 27 
 Economy  
o Health care, higher education, and government sectors as stabilizers in changing times  
o Supportive networks and services for entrepreneurs and innovators willing to take a chance on an 
idea  
o Opportunities to link all sectors and modes of transportation for movement of people and goods in and through the region  
Community  
o Commitment to collaborative approaches that leverage the distinctiv e strengths of each partner 
and create a whole greater than the sum of its parts  
o Belief in the power of education to align with and support the needs of business and society to 
improve opportunity and outcomes for everyone by educating, retaining and investing in our 
workforce  
o Dedication to the cultivation of an inclusive community spirit that welcomes people bringing all 
varieties of the human experience to build our region together  
Measurement of success as a community includes evaluation of how citize ns, businesses and institutions 
work together to create opportunity for an education, a living- wage career, a secure eco nomic climate, and 
an affordable, healthy lifestyle without compromising quality and opportunities for future citizens.  
So, it’s only n atural that we tap into this legacy and this collaborative spirit as we pursue our vi sion of a 
Smart City proving ground in Spokane.  
Spokane University District Smart City Accelerator  
Cross -sector collaborators in Spokane have  been developing the Spokane S mart City Accelerator for 
nearly two years. The unique collaboration of the City  of Spokane , Avista  Utilities , Itron, W ashington State 
University , the University District Development Association and McKinstry describes the accelerator as 
follows:  
The Spoka ne Smart City Accelerator is a living laboratory to design cities for the future. Located in the 
University District, we harness data to gain insights, empower people and solve urban challenges in new 
ways. We enable:  
o healthier  citizens  
o safer  neighborhoods  
o smarter  infrastructure   
o more sustainable environment  
o stronger  economy  
The Smart City Accelerator stands out from other smart city initiatives in its ambition to establish a 
technology proving ground which is geographically bounded in the 770 acres of S pokane’s University 
District and that is a standards -based, open architecture, open data and open analytics platform for 
innovation.   
With funding from the US DOT Smart City Challenge Spokane will apply these principles across the 
transportation sector wit h primary emphasis on multi -mode mobility,  transit and transportation 
electrification.  USDOT Smart City Challenge -  Spokane

In December of 2015, Spokane was selected to be among the first 10 cities in America to participate in a 
program sponsored by Envision America. As part of the selection, Spokane joins  9 other cities in a year long 
support effort preceded by an intensive workshop which was held in January, 2016 . Spokane is being 
recognized for its efforts in becoming a safer, stronger and smarter city. Formation of Envision America, a 
national nonprofit, was announced in September of this year during a White House event in which the 
Administration announced a new “Smart Cities” Initiative to help communities tackle local challenges and improve city services. Envision A merica , focuses on ch allenging America’s cities to become smarter by 
accelerating deployment of innovative technologies . This opportunity has engaged a number of industry 
and public sector partners in mentoring Spokane’s success in further developing its connected innovation platform.  
The proposed approach will use advanced data and intelligent transportation systems and applications  in a 
balanced and diversified approach to reduce congestion, improve safety, respond to climate change, 
connect underserved communities, and support economic vitality.  
Local Challenges Lead to Translational Solutions  
  
Spokane is focusing on improving i ts most integrated and impactful economic performance indicators. The 
economic dimensions of our community are the primary levers for improving our outcomes. Median 
household income is inc reasing at a rate faster than any other community in the State of Washington. This 
trend must continue. Additionally Spokane will continue its efforts to continuously improve the quality and 
condition of the Spokane River. The project initiatives funded by  this proposal clearly support Spokane’s 
aspirations.   
 The Connected Transportation Innovation Platform and the goals and objectives of Spokane’s University District are central to catalyzing our signature collaborative approach to these local challenges.  Public, 
private and non- profit entities are u nified in their approach to the  issue s mentioned above and those listed 
below.  
 
Spokane Challenges –

 Intended Outcomes   
 
The award made in this grant will shift the adoption curve of transportation electrification (transit, 
commercial, private) by orders of magnitude as well as sign ificantly accelerate the well -developed plans to 
establish Spokane’ s University District as a smart city proving ground  resulting in the following benefits 
from the demonstration project  completed during the period of performance:  
a) Substantially higher penetration rate of personal electric vehicles  and electric vehicles of all 
types  
b) Electrification of  a significant segment of the regional transit fleet (emphasis on accelerating 
the Central City Line - high performance transit  and other  major  fixed routes serving the 
Downtown core. ) 
c) Electric  vehicle charging infrastructure in sufficient density  and type  to enable all transportation 
modes access to convenient charging network  and reducing barriers to adoption.  
d) Ability to work out regulatory and licensing hurdles  at community -scale  
e) Demonstrate the economic value proposition for a wide spectrum of the consumer market for cleaner transit and transportation.  
f) Demonstrate the integration of all modes of transportation with the University District as the 
focal point  and provide feedback regarding the health impacts of each mode in the mix so that 
people can make  individual and informed mode choices.  
g) Measurable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions  during the grant period of performance  
h) Shifting the trajectory of the adoption curve in a geographically isolated urban area such as 
Spokane is easier to implement and easier to measure than other  more complex urban areas.  
i) Opportunity to track migration from rural to urban population trends and the impacts that advanced transportation options impart on the urban migration trends  as well as public healt h 
outcomes . 
j) Fully develops and s upplements the already -planned smart city technology accelerator in the 
University District  
k) Accelerates the density of s ensor networks, communications infrastructure and data sharing 
hurdles are already being addresse d. 
l) Demonstrate technology -assisted freight and delivery options . Incentivize adoption of EV 
deliveries.  
m) Integrated parking strategy and shared vehicles integration will be demonstrated. Every aspect of how parking can shape the community and the transportation choices people make will be 
examined and will be the subject  of multiple academic investigations.  
n) Pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure will be improved in conjunction with the high performance 
transit and University District improvements funded by the grant proceeds.  ITS applications in 
the University District are intended to focus first on the pedestrian and cyclist rather than the 
motor vehicles. Machine learning techniques will be applied.  
o) The sensor network planned for the University District will be designed to achieve healthier 
people, safer neighborhoods, smarter infrastructure, a more sustainable environment and  a 
stronger economy. Together these characteristics substantially define a vibrant resilient city of 
choice.  
p) Leverage the 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that result from driving electric 
vehicles powered by the mix of hydropower and other clean electric power sources available in 
Spokane, compared to driving a gasoline- fueled vehicle, at less than $1 per gallon equivalent. USDOT Smart City Challenge -  Spokane

 Given that Spokane and the Inland Northwest in general currently has a relatively low EV 
adoption rate, the scaled -up and accelerated EVS E project will demonstrate to what degree 
strong utility involvement  in partnership with the community  can stimulate higher EV adoption 
rates – a key question yet to be conclusively demonstrated anywhere in the nation, with 
important ramifications as a model  for other utilities and cities both large and small  
 
Specifically, the initiatives supported by the US Department of Transportation Smart City Challenge 
in Spokane are summarized as follows:  
1. Accelerate Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment in Urban Core  
Avista Utilities has filed a pilot plan with the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission to install  
AC Level 2 Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) at the following locations: 120 residential single-
family homes (SFH), 100 at workplaces, fleet and multi -unit dwelling (MUD) locations, and at 45 public 
locations. In addition to the AC Level 2 EVSE installations, Avista is proposing to install DC Fast Charging 
EVSE at seven locations as part of the pilot program  enabling regional travel with electri c vehicles (EV) and 
addressing a key barrier to EV adoption.  
All Level 2 installations will be completed at sites that are customers of Avista. Of the AC Level 2 EVSE 
installations, “smartchargers” will be planned for installation in 100 residential and 90 other locations. 
Smartchargers provide enhanced capabilities that allow for data acquisition, network communication, and demand response, which is essential to determine baseline charging profiles, enable demand response experiments, and ultimately help shape the long term impact of EV charging for the greatest benefit of all 
customers.    
The illustration below shows how the various installations, network services and interfaces relate to each 
other in the proposed pilot.  
 USDOT Smart City Challenge -  Spokane  
Page 8 of 27 
  
 
In addition to stimulating greater EV adoption rates, this pilot program will enable a comprehensive, 
integrated understanding of EV charging at home, at work and in public areas –  what is needed, what is 
effective, and how it may affect the grid in the future.  It will further demonstrate the economic and 
environmental benefits that may be achieved with a transition to electric transportation –  leveraging the 
80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that result from driving electric vehicles powered by the mix of hydropower and other relatively clean electric power sources available in our area, compared to driving a 
gasoline- fueled vehicle, at less than $1 per gallon equivalent. Given that Spokane and the Inland Northwest 
in general currently has a relatively low EV adoption rate, t he EVSE pilot will demonstrate to what degree 
strong utility involvement  in partnership with the community  can stimulate higher EV adoption rates –  a key 
question yet to be conclusively demonstrated anywhere in the nation, with important ramifications as a model for other utilities and cities both large and small.  Another important finding from this pilot will be to 
show to what degree EV charging may be accomplished during periods of low system demand for electricity (“off -peak” charging), administered by  the utility, while maintaining high customer satisfaction.  
This will show how utility grid assets may be more highly utilized, thereby minimizing costs and capacity 
investments to handle increased peak loads that would otherwise result in increased greenhouse gas 
emissions.  In sum, the pilot will provide an immediate stimulus to higher EV adoption rates, and position the utility and policymakers to make informed long- term decisions that maximize benefi ts for all community 
members in the years ahead.   
With additional funding from the USDOT Smart  City Challenge, Avista will quadruple the number of AC 
Level 2 installed in workplace, fleet, and multiple- unit dwelling (MUD) locations, and double the number of 
public AC Level 2 and DC fast charging installatio ns, thereby supporting an accelerated EV adoption rate.  
Workplace charging in particular has been shown to be a highly effective catalyst for higher EV adoption, 
and therefore will play a central role in an expanded program (US Depar tment  of Energy Workpl ace

 Charging Challenge Progress Update 2014, 
http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/11/f27/WPCC_2014progressupdate_1114.pdf ) 
Funds will also be utilized to greatly increase the level of outreach and education programs, including those 
to stimulate commercial electric fleets and the formation of an electric EV loaner and ridesharing fleet for 
participants in the program, and in partnership with other organizations to enable economical EV driving by low income members of the community.  
2. Significantly Accelerate Electrification of Transit System    
Present plans for migrating the Spokane Transit Authority fixed- route bus fleet to electric following normal 
capital equipment replacement schedules have full conversion system -wide by 2031 . Under this proposal, it 
is planned that the Central City Line high performance transit route and other major fixed routes serving the University District will be converted during the pe rformance period.   
3. Augment the Transit System Serving the University District  
We have an existing coordination of private and public leadership poised to make our  University District the 
most advanced transit oriented neighborhood in the Pacific Northwest . This includes mobility on demand 
(MOD) and shared- use options (bikes, cars, scooters) as defined by extensive survey of residents’ stated 
needs and research/pilot outcomes from other cities. Implement all manners and forms of programs and 
rate structures  that reduce or eliminate barriers to use.  We will e xpand the availability of the existing 
Universal Transit Access Pass (UTAP) program and integrate with MOD services and infrastructure. This 
will require advances in fare technology, distribution channels  and a more open data architecture to allow 
for integrat ion with other mobility providers, including public and private entities. Enhance and improve 
passenger waiting areas to incorporate additional traveler information that supports this advanced 
integration of mobility.   
We have already made monumental strides in creating “people- first” urba n condition.  As part of the largest 
single transportation investment in state history, Spokane will soon realize a landmark pedestrian bridge 
expanding the ways to m ove in the city.  Already, developers, city planners, and citizens are engaging the 
opportunities offered by increased mobility .  Public response to current high performance transit proposals 
demonstrate that our community is enthusiastic about embracing f uture outside of the condition of single -
occupancy cars.  
4. Accelerate the Full Extent of the ICT/Data Functionality of the University District Smart City Technology Accelerator  
Even though  the strategy being implemented is comprised of building an open archi tecture, open data, 
open analytics platform  with edge intelligence to be used for rapid prototyping and innovation; the effort is 
not manifested in the simply in the  platform. Technology is a necessary enabler but Spokane’s  initiative 
goes far beyond techn ology to incent people to take control of the destiny of a city (or district) with goals, 
aspirations and its own unique fingerprint.  Thus, the crucial step to create a digital master plan will be 
accelerated under the Connected Transportation Innovation P latform project. The digital master plan, 
among many other outcomes, will produce a functional governance model for  the management of the data 
resource which also addresses data privacy as well as cyber security issues from inception and for the long 
haul.  Due to the unique multi -jurisdiction, multi- stakeholder nature of the proposed data and analytics 
platform, there is a distinct need to collaboratively address planning for the digital future of the District.  That 
need will be met. Additionally, the City will complete the establishment of citywide cyber security and open USDOT Smart City Challenge -  Spokane  
Page 10 of 27 
 data policies near the beginning of the period of performance. More information about the shared data and 
communications platform architecture can be found later in this proposal.  See Data Integration.  
 
5. University District Integrated Parking Strategy  
The City of Spokane and The University District Development Association are already  pursuing a University 
District Integrated Parking and Urban Mobility Strategy  which focus es on the relations hip between parking 
and urban form.   The project  will create a model that will inform and lead development in The University 
district toward  new urban possibilities and mobili ty priorities.   The project  concentrates on an integrated 
parking strategy while incorporating broader transit, pedestrian and mobility  interests.   The goal is to  
optimize the role played by parking in both economic development and the mobility chain in The University 
District, thus impacting how we get around in our City as well as what type of city we are developing.  
There are important synergies with the known smart c ity enablers and because the University District is the 
focal point of  the Smart City Accelerator Initiative.   So called, “smart parking” is where new technologies 
merg e with parking systems.    In addition to widely deployed technologies such as, credit card and Pay -by-
cell functionality, future “smart” functionality  to be installed in the University District  will include real- time 
data and analytics, resulting in parkin g guidance technologies, user reservation systems, predictive 
enforcement and collections, more complex user considerations and more sustainable technology, design, 
and innovation possibilities.  In conjunction with Spokane’s proposed plans resulting from t he Envision 
America challenge and award, the integrated parking strategy reflects the receptive environment for 
integrating new technology with policy innovations.  
 
6. Generate and Test Complementary Connected Transportation Applications  
We have a number of leading research and technology innovator s from Itron, a glo bal leader  in over 100 
countries specializing in device and control technology, data analysis and smart grid technology, to Tango, electric commuter cars, based in Spokane. Research projects range from smart city work by the Integrated Design Lab at Washington State University, focusing on a holistic approach for sustainability, to a team 
developing refueling station s for vehicles that run  on hydrogen fuel -cell systems sponsored by the U.S 
Depart ment of Energy and National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  Our distinct capabilities in energy, 
education, and transportation leadership enable us to collaborate on the problem of transportation, focusing 
on solutions that are sustainable in the senses of social, environmental and climate impacts.  Our local 
transportation thought leaders are very active at the state and national level working smart growth policies and landmark, light rail developments for example.  
The multitude and diversity of research and demonstration projects proposed are connected through 
integrated design of the built environment. Like a digital platform that connects autonomous devices in smart environments, the physical infrastructure, buildings, and streetscapes in the 770 acre University District (polygon) and the 6 mile long Central City Line (spline) serve as a unifying platform for an infinite number of research project test -beds. The WSU Integrated Design Lab in Spokane specializes in 
stakeholder engagement and technical assistance to realize this coordination in the design of near -human 
and infrastructure scale projects.

 2) Spokane Attributes - Population  
 
Spokane C ity - 2010 population: 208,733 – 53.84% of the urbanized area, with a population density of 
3,526 persons per square mile.  The City of Spokane is 49% denser than the urbanized area in which it is 
situated.  
As of 2010, there were 123,127 jobs within the City of Spokane. This represented 63.1% of all jobs within 
the Spokane urbanized area.  (Source: OnTheMap.census.gov)  
As of 201 0, 18.7% of Spokane residents had incomes below the poverty level (Source: US Census Burea u, 
2006- 2010 ACS Survey 5 -Year Estimate)  
 
3) Spokane Attributes – Smart City  
Spokane’ s ong oing commitment (two years) to establish a smart city proving ground in its University District 
is evidence of clear intentions to not only embrace, but to capitalize upon the principles in the USDOT 
Smart City Challenge.  
Spokane Transit provides over 11 million annual passenger trips and travels over 6 million miles within its 
Public Transportation Benefit Area (PTBA) annually, serving the cities of Airway Heights, Cheney, Liberty 
Lake, Medical Lake, Millwood, Spokane, and Spokane Valley as well as parts of unincorpor ated Spokane 
County.  The system includes 34, fixed routes, complementary Paratransit services and a robust vanpool program. There are over 1600 designated stops around the region. Currently there are seven fixed routes 
that directly serve the University D istrict. There are four corridors in the district that are served with frequent 
(buses every 15 minutes) for 12 hours a day on weekdays.  
In conjunction with Spokane’s proposed plans resul ting from the Envision America challenge and award, 
the integrated parking strategy reflects the receptive environment for integrating new technology with policy innovations . 
A commitment to integrating with the sharing economy is inherent in the tight -knit fabric of all community 
stakeholders.  We realize that smart cities empower their  residents with information and we have a proven 
track record in creating partnerships and alliances to leverage and share creativity, expertise and insights.  This long standing cooperation has a profound application as we liberate date and empower others  to 
engage in the design of intelligent urban spaces that serve our unique attributes.

Transit services   
Spokane Transit Authority provides over 11 million annual passenger trips and travels over 6 million miles 
within its Public Transportation Benefit Area (PTBA) annually, serving the cities of Airway Heights, Cheney, 
Liberty Lake, Medical Lake, Millwood, Spokane, and Spokane Valley as well as parts of unincorporated 
Spokane County.  The system includes 34, fixed routes, complementary Paratransit services and a robust 
vanpool program. There are over 1600 designated stops around the region.  
 
Information and communication technology (ICT)    
Spokane is a critically important regional telecommunications hub and home to a multitude of major Tier 1 
providers as well as regional Tier 2, Tier 3 and local service providers. Spokane provides redundancy and diversity to numerous carriers and their networks in locations like Seattle,  Denver, Portland, and Salt Lake 
City, as well as the Midwest.  
 
Spokane County is a fiber and telecommunication rich community. Early adaption and private and public 
investment into digital infrastructure resulted in kudos from publications such as Time M agazine. Spo kane 
has garnered awards from the Intelligent Community Forum and the National League of Cities for technology innovation. The Spokane region was ranked in Sperling’s Best Places #12 Best Cities for 
Teleworking. Spokane is also consistently ra nked as one of the safest cities from natural disaster.  
The aggressive network build- out of multiple telecommunications companies has left the region’s new, 
commercial, industrial and many beautiful and historically significant buildings wired. Redundancy  and 
diversity in local and regional telecommunications, data networks, energy and power sources is both common, affordable and reliable
.  
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) including transportation management centers and 
field equipment   
 
The Spokane Regional Tr ansportation Management Center (SRTMC)  was created as a multi -jurisdictional 
control facility to enhance and support advanced transportation management capabilities. The SRTMC is 
controlled and funded by the Cities of Spokane and Spokane Valley, Spokane Transit Authority, Spokane 
County, Washington State Department of Transportation, and the Spokane Regional Transportation 
Council.  
 Located in the heart of Spokane at the Intermodal Center (Amtrak rail and Greyhound bus station), the 
SRTMC is a 900 square- foot facility providing three full workstations for operators, two 84- inch rear 
projection LCD displays, and nine analog video monitors.  
 The SRTMC has been a 24/7 operation since November 2003.  The center operators coordinate closely 
with loca l first response agencies, the regional 911 center, and the state police from Washington and Idaho. 
From the center, the operators have access and control to most of the region’ s devices used to monitor and 
control traffic, which include nearly three dozen closed- circuit TV cameras, six dynamic message signs, 
twenty traffic measurement stations, and three highway advisory radio stations.  USDOT Smart City Challenge -  Spokane  
Page 16 of 27 
  
There are currently two Advanced Traffic Management Systems [ATMSs] deployed in the Spokane Region. 
The ACTRA system was  deployed approximately seven years ago for the control of ~220 traffic signals 
owned and controlled by the City of Spokane. The i2TMS system was deployed in 2001 for the control of 
closed -circuit cameras [CCTV], dynamic message signs [DMS], and traffic si gnal control devices owned 
and controlled by Spokane County, the City of Spokane Valley, and the Washington State Department of 
Transportation [WSDOT].  
 
The SRTMC includes a center -to-center [C2C] communications link between the ACTRA and i2 systems 
for sh aring traffic data in near real -time. The C2C link passes signal status and traffic volume data from the 
ACTRA system to the i2 system so that the TMC operators can monitor field operations of the signals. The C2C link was developed in accordance with Nati onal Transportation Communications for Intelligent 
Transportation System Protocol [NTCIP] standards.  
The Spokane region has deployed a network of fiber optic communication links along key regional arterials 
with full build out providing redundant rings. Currently, there is fiber optic cable running along I -90 and 
along Division (major north- south roadway). Many ITS devices are connected to the fiber optic 
communication system, such as DMSs, CCTVs, and traffic signals.  
 The region has also successfully deployed a wireless communication system. Presently, there are six 
CCTV cameras bringing near real -time video images back to the TMC. There are a few traffic signals that 
are communicating via wireless communication.  
 
From the SRTMC, the operators have current status information of ITS devices throughout the region, even 
though there are different operating systems controlling those devices. The regional system collects 
information about ITS devices and displays that information on a single view. No special soft ware is needed 
to view the regional system it is a web- services based application, and the user only needs a standard web 
browser. From a single application, the operator can visually assess freeway flow conditions, view and control CCTV cameras, place mes sages on DMSs, implement response plans, check the status of traffic 
signals, and analyze historical traffic performance.  
 
The Spokane system measures traffic volume and speed using roadway sensors (data collection stations). 
The roadway sensors are remote microwave sensors by EIS. There are a number of data collection 
stations currently deployed along Interstate 90, with plans for future expansion. These data are collected on 30-second polling periods and stored in a relational database for near real -time and historical analysis. The 
Spokane system uses the Performance Measurement System [PeMS], which is integrated with the regional system described above. Using the PeMS application, the system users can view roadway performance over a historical time period and view the results in a wide variety of formats. The PeMS system provides users the ability to monitor detector performance, health, and perform troubleshooting, if needed.

Smart Grid Infrastructure including electric vehicle charging infrastructure   
Avista  Utilities’ Smart Grid Infrastructure is an extremely capable, reliable, automated, and extensible 
system – providing a solid foundation for additional integration of transportation solutions.  It includes fully 
automated 24x7 distribution grid monitoring and control of field assets and customer met ers to improve 
reliability, capture energy efficiency, and facilitate customer participation.  The smart grid components 
consist of the following; distribution management system (DMS), municipal 802.11 wi -fi network, long range 
low bandwidth radio network,  fiber network backhaul, automated meter infrastructure (AMI), transactive 
signal control system, smart switches for sectionalizing, smart voltage regulators for voltage management, smart faulted circuit indicators, and smart capacitor banks for power fact or correction.  The diagram below 
provides the architectural view of the components.  Note: some components are not yet available in the 
target location in Spokane’s University District  such as smart transformers and smart thermostats.  USDOT Smart City Challenge -  Spokane  
Page 18 of 27 
 The Avista smart gri d infrastructure network features are depicted in the following 
diagram:  
 
 
USDOT Smart City Challenge -  Spokane  
Page 19 of 27 
 Installed components are summarized in the following table:  
 
 
DMS  (Distribution Management System)  
The DMS system controls all smart field devices remotely and performs automated restoration, 
conservation voltage reduction (CVR), and power factor correction. The system is a distribution SCADA 
system with add -on predictive applications to perform Fault Detection, Isolation and Restoration (FDIR) as 
well as Integrated Volt VAR Control (IVVC).  The system leverages a distribution model from Avista’s geographical information system (GIS) that provides a connected graphical representation of the feeders 
USDOT Smart City Challenge -  Spokane  
Page 20 of 27 
 and all its components in the DMS. Given that the predictive applications are model based, the DMS model 
needed to clearly represent all electrical components, smart and non- smart. An important operational 
aspect is the real time device status syncing of all devices (smart and non- smart) between the DMS and 
the GIS based Outage Management System (OMS).  
Faulted Circuit Indicators (FCI)  
Avista has deployed smart Fault Circuit Indicators (FCI) to further enhance the capabilities of the DMS and the Outage management System (OMS). The FCIs are located at key junction points to detect fault curre nt 
and help identify the actual location of a fault. The information gathered from the Fault Circuit Indicators is transmitted using On- Ramp wireless communication technology. The On- Ramp technology has a much 
greater range than 802.11 technology but less data bandwidth.  
Fault Detection Isolation and Restoration  
One of the predictive applications of the DMS system is Fault Detection Isolation and Restoration (FDIR). 
FDIR allows for increased reliability for customers with rapid restoration (under 3 minutes) when a feeder breaker has opened due to a fault on the feeder. FDIR analyzes all the fault targets it receives from the switches and breakers along that feeder to determine which section the fault is located in. Once the application determines the fault  location, FDIR send commands to the switches or breakers both upstream 
and downstream of the fault for isolation followed by restoration from available sources.  
Integrated Volt/ Var Control (IVVC)  
IVVC is one of the predictive applications supported by the DMS. IVVC has two main components: 
Capacitor Bank Control (CBC) and Voltage Control (VC).  Capacitor Bank Control (CBC) is the application 
for power factor correction. CBC allows remotely controllable capacitor banks to be operated based on predetermined and defined KVAR parameters. Every 30 seconds, CBC determines the need for KVAR and 
controls capacitor banks as appropriate. Voltage Control (VC) remotely controls voltage regulators based on results of a power flow calculation done every 30 seconds which reveals the high and low voltage values 
on the feeder.  These high/low values determine the voltage set point to maximize savings by lowering 
voltage.  
Transactive Signal Control System  
The transactive signal control system uses a predictive time series based value signal to inform distributed 
energy resources, such as electric vehicles, when to complete energy transactions for optimal benefit (both 
customer and utility).  The transactive signal control system has been used for smart thermostats, chillers, air handlers, and generators.  The system is easily extended for the application of EV chargers.  
Communications 
Avista’s smart grid data and communications backhaul is supported by a private high speed and high 
bandwidth fiber infrastructure MPLS backbone that also supports substation integration and corporate 
network data and voice communications to Avista offices and generation facilities. An 802.11 wireless mesh network blankets the Avista smart devices.  An additional low bandwidth, long range network, provided by On- Ramp provides event data from selected field components.  
Security  
Avista maintains a Cyber Security Plan that is deliberate and strategic with focus on risk assessment, selection of controls, implementation of controls, assessment of control s, authorization for the system of 
controls, and monitoring the controls.  This strategy has been dubbed the “Security Life Cycle Approach” USDOT Smart City Challenge -  Spokane  
Page 21 of 27 
 and is intended to be repeated over time as technologies and their respective risk profiles change and 
evolve.  
 
Adva nced Metering Infrastructure ( AMI) 
The advanced meter infrastructure supplied by Itron provides nearly unlimited opportunity at the edge of the 
grid (customer). The technology provides 1 second measures that can predict many grid anomalies and also facilit ate peer to peer transactions with other smart devices leaving unforeseeable opportunities to 
realize benefits via integration with EV chargers and electric vehicles.  
Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) Infrastructure  
Current EVSE infrastructure is very limited and is not integrated with the smart grid.  The level of current 
infrastructure will be dramatically increased and carefully located to maximize support for higher EV 
adoption rates.

9) Data I ntegration   
Spokane Regional Transportation Management Center  
The Spokane Regional Transportation Management Center sustains regional transportati on data 
integration as follows:  
•Center -to-center communication using national standards (XML)  
•Type of data shared: traffic signal status, phase status, volume and speed data  
•Regional Response Plan System: command traffic patterns across two traffic control systems.  
 
The City of Spokane  
The City of Spokane is committed to providing information that promotes government transparency and 
accountability. Citizens are  provided  with information that encourages and invites public participation and 
feedback. N ew datasets will be added periodically, and the City  welcome s suggestions.  
https://my.spokanecity.org/opendata/   
City of Spokane Privacy Statement: “ All datasets accessed through [the above website ] are confined to 
public information and m ust not contain personal or privileged information as defined by law, or other 
information that is protected by statute, practice or legal precedent. ” 
 
Connected Transportation Innovation Platform  
Spokane is building a coordinated network for sensing and c ommunication to support it smart city 
accelerator and this Smart City Challenge proposal. Coordinated network refers to the fact that partners will 
design and operate infrastructure that promotes  coordination for the purpose of gaining efficiencies.  The 
value proposition centers on shared network backhaul for a variety of digital endpoints.   Endpoint owners 
will take advantage of a coordinated network to transport their data into owner data centers for business 
operations.  
Satisfying the core business oper ations, the data owners might extend their use of the coordinated network 
for transportation of shared data elements to a common cloud service platform.   The common platform will 
create opportunity to “mash up” multi -owner shared endpoint data with “Intern et of Things” public data.   The 
availability of an analytics engine for “big data” will enable a variety of application development opportunities using a data integration and application as a platform service technology stack (xPaaS).    
Use of the coordinated network will facilitate access to a cloud service “platform for innovation”.  
While there may be several partners/owners of a coordinated network and other infrastructure, there will 
eventually need to be mutual understanding of the administration, oper ations and maintenance.    A 
governance team for performance and security management will be formed as an initial step .  The 
coordinated network principles and design parameters illustrated in the following exhibit will guide.  
Adherence to the evolving principles and parameters will yi eld a stable operating model.   Additionally, 
operating principles between additional member entities will be developed.  
 
 
 
Overarching principles and design parameter s: 
 Versatile  infrastructure that can flex with each use case.  
 Common foundation for  Secure delivery of data to 'data owner'.  
 An architecture that accommodates a Diverse  and transit endpoint population.  USDOT Smart City Challenge -  Spokane  
Page 23 of 27 
  
DRAFT Utility and 3rd party - principles/design parameters:  
 Endpoint population limited to U -District boundary.  
 Endpoin t adoption process will include a cross functional governance team.  
 Endpoint inventory will be centrally maintained.  
 Network design to encompass endpoint and data owner service agreement.  
 Network design will align with member data privacy and liability agr eement.

etc.), access control, data volume, application latency requirements.  
 Security assessment will precede endpoint provisioning.  
 Security Informa tion and Event Management (SEIM) system will be implemented.  
 Security event and incident information will be shared with member companies under NDA.  Data breach 
emergency operating procedures will be established.  
 'Big Data' repository and analytics engine will be a cloud service.  
DRAFT Operating principles for how City and Avista wi ll approach combined any Services with  AMI: 
 Endpoint provisioning process team should be defined (RACI)  
 Network operate and maintain team should be defined (RACI)  
 Service level metrics and problem management operating agreement.  
 Change management operating  agreement.  
 Data privacy and liability agreement.  
 Investment or operating cost agreement.  
 NDA and public information sharing agreement.  USDOT Smart City Challenge -  Spokane

 Draft Conceptual Reference Architecture:  
 
 
The above depiction is a conceptual draft only and has not yet been adopted by the partners. It is provided 
here as evidence of the thought that has already been invested in the issues of interoperable data sets as 
well as the security, privacy and sharing thereof.  
10) Existing Standards, Architectures and Certifi cation Processes   
 
As shown in Section  – Data Integration, all of Spokane’s innovation platform design principles are aimed at 
complying with and incorporating all existing standards, architectures and certification processes.  
11) Measurable Goals and Objectiv es  
 
Goals and objectives are set for all of the initiatives and projects described in this proposal. The 
measurable goals and objectives upon award will be accelerated because of the award to achieve desired results in most cases two years sooner than now  published.  
 
  
USDOT Smart City Challenge -  Spokane  
Page 25 of 27 
 1. Accelerate the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment in the Urban Core  
With additional funding from the USDOT Smart City Challenge, Avista will quadruple the number of AC 
Level 2 installed in workplace, fleet, and multiple- unit dwelling (MUD) locations, and double the number of 
public AC Level 2 and DC fast charging installations.  
 
2. Significantly Accelerate Electrification of Transit System  
Present plans for migrating the Spokane Transit Authority fixed- route bus fleet to electric following norm al 
capital equipment replacement schedules have full conversion system -wide by 2031 . Under this proposal, it 
is planned that the Central City Line high performance transit route and other major fixed routes serving the University District will be converted  during the performance period.  
3. Augment the Transit System Serving the University District  
We will expand the availability of the existing Universal Transit Access Pass (UTAP) program and integrate with MOD services and infrastructure. This will require advances in fare technology, distribution channels 
and a more open data architecture to allow for integrat ion with other mobility providers, including public and 
private entities. Enhance and improve passenger waiting areas to incorporate additional traveler 
information that supports this advanced integration of mobility.  
4. Accelerate the Full Extent of the ICT/Data Functionality of the University District 
Smart City Technology Accelerator  
The goals described in the Data Integration section will lead the tas ks in the resulting funded project.  
5. University District Integrated Parking Strategy  
The project concentrates on an integrated parking strategy while incorporating broader transit, pedestrian 
and mobility interests.  The goal is to optimize the role played by parking in both economic development and 
the mobility chain in The University District. The full launch and implementation of this initiative will be accelerated by at least two years with funding from the Smart City Challenge.  
6. Generate and Test Complementary Connected Transportation Applications  
The resulting platform is designed as a platform for research, development and deployment of all forms. Research proposals are already in the review pipeline for implementation in Spokane’s University District.  
 
12) Leverage    
 
The City of Spokane and Spokane Transit Authority have the opportunity to leverage Federal Highway 
Administration and Federal Transit Administration funding.  SRTC is responsible for selecting projects for 
the federal Surface Transportation Program (STP), Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP), and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) program funds. These funds are not eligible for matching other federal funds.  However, projects selected under these funding programs could demonstrate partnering (e.g. ITS projects) among regional entities.

Conclusion  
The Smart City is, fundamentall y, no different from great cities: a people place. The Smart City places the 
needs and aspirations of its people ahead of competing priories. Technology is the means and not the end 
of this vision…..  The US Department of Transportation and Vulcan Foundation dollars invested in Spokane 
will go farther toward the goals of Beyond Traffic 2045 than possible in any other mid- sized city.

1.0 Vision Overview
Indianapolis’ (Indy’s) vision for Smart Cities is to support a connected, healthy, resilient, 
inclusive, and competitive city. Technology provides a platform where we can realize this 
vision. By balancing innovation with stewardship, Indy’s vision will achieve the best 
individual mobility for residents both economically and in terms of transportation. 
Connecting our systems of transportation, communications, emergency services, and data 
will enable the city to maximize resources, make smarter investments, and attract talent. 
Indy has long been at the forefront of transportation innovation.  We built the first union 
railroad station in the nation.  The Indy 500, which celebrates 100th running this year, was 
started as a testing ground for automotive innovation, with technologies like front wheel drive, 
seat belts, and alternative fuel research coming out of the race.  Its founder, Carl Fisher, 
conceived of the Lincoln Highway, one of the earliest transcontinental highways built in the 
nation.  Highways have always been important, with Indy having been the intersection of the 
National Road and the Dixie Highway, and today being connected by more interstate 
highways than any other city in the nation.  More recently, Indy set the bar for urban trails 
with our Indianapolis Cultural Trail, an 8-mile bicycle and pedestrian network downtown lined 
with public art, streetscaping, and linking our cultural districts, destinations, and regional 
trails.  We also set the bar for modern airports, building the only new airport since 9/11 to 
continued acclaim. The city is putting the finishing touches on its RebuildIndy program, a 
$500 million infrastructure investment initiative that repaved streets, added bike lanes and 
greenway trails, and rebuilt bridges.  Through a public-private partnership, North America’s 
largest all-electric car share program, BlueIndy, is open and expanding.  And soon Indy will 
build America’s first electric bus-rapid transit (e-BRT).  Time and time again, Indy has been at 
the forefront of transportation innovation and the management of significant public 
infrastructure investments, and with the help of Smart Cities, we’ll deliver again. 
Technology has revolutionized the way we travel and manage city infrastructure. From the 
advent of vehicle-detecting traffic signals to real-time crowd-sourced GPS systems 
innovations have enhanced user experience and improved system efficiency. Private sector 
innovation will bring automated vehicles to our streets in a matter of years.  We must bring 
this same level of innovation to the public sector—into the way our infrastructure is built, 
programmed, and connected, into the way our systems work together to promote mobility and 
system efficiency, into the way our users access and pay for the network, and into the way we 
make investments for the long term that are data-driven yet flexible.  Indianapolis will take 
advantage of these opportunities through a Smart Corridor model built around personalized 
mobility using new technologies to expand consumer options, build safer and engaged 
communities, and spark new solutions while maximizing system capacity. 
This strategy includes:
• Automation of bus rapid transit (BRT) & car share routes
• Dynamic pricing & Transportation Savings Accounts 
• Personalized mobility app/interface 
• Intelligent infrastructure & Intelligent Traffic Systems (ITS) 
• Real-time data & dynamic modeling to manage travel demand
The Smart Corridor model will use pilot corridors, including the planned electric-bus rapid 
transit network, downtown arterial grid, and major commuting arterial streets as sites for INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 2integrated transportation technologies. The base of this system requires the installation and 
support of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) and dynamic analytics using 
a cloud-based platform available in real-time. This model will provide a feedback loop, where 
real-time traffic information motivates transportation choice, maximizes the capacity of our 
existing infrastructure, and helps government and community leaders plan for and evaluate 
transportation investments.  
The Smart Corridor objectives are to reduce congestion, improve air quality and safety, and 
enhance mobility through:
1. System optimization: Using connected signs, signals and raised pavement LED/light 
markers (similar to INROADS) and monitors, operators will be able to remotely program 
infrastructure to accommodate congestion, manage emergencies, and redirect overflow 
traffic to priority corridors.
2. Improved safety and on-time performance: Installing the infrastructure for users to predict 
and avoid crashes, support connected and autonomous vehicles and eBRT lines will provide 
a more predictable, smooth, and safe user experience.
3. Improve resident safety and mobility: A user interface will integrate real-time data on all 
modes and payment platforms, provide live routing based on congestion, allow live 
reporting, enhance trip chaining, and encourage mode shift through economic incentives. 
4. Dynamic pricing: Building a base audience and capital reserve through major 
employers, Indy will provide transportation savings accounts to app users accessible through 
the Internet to implement congestion pricing incentivizing transit, biking, and walking based 
on real-time traffic flow information made possible through cloud computing.
1.1 Element 1: Commercial Integration of Autonomous and Connected Vehicle Technology
Indianapolis is unique as the only city in the United States that stands ready to automate 
transportation systems in a clean and sustainable approach. Indianapolis offers and is 
developing an electric transportation system including BlueIndy, an all-electric car-share 
service, and the eBRT “Red-Line.” Combined, these systems are the result of more than $100 
million invested in their initial phases.  Electrifying the city’s vehicle fleet alone has saved over 
42,000 gallons of gas and will contribute to Indy’s goal of becoming a resilient city by 
reducing oil demand and emissions through congestion reduction, vehicle efficiency, and 
managing electric demand. Urban automation requires a variety of testing environments 
which are captured by the following sub-projects and as defined by the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) levels of automation:
Sub-project #1: Automation of Red-Line eBRT system
Set for early 2017, the nation’s first all-electric BRT (eBRT) Red Line is an ideal platform to 
model automation for public transit. The Indianapolis Smart City initiative would identify and 
finance the support and infrastructure needed to implement and operate a fully 
automated and electric Red Line.  Advantages to automating all-electric BRT:
1. Buses will operate in a dedicated lane (lane divider lines or physical barriers)
2. The Smart Corridor will include sophisticated ITS which could be leveraged for V2I 
    communication that will improve autonomous technology performance 
3. Provide smoother ride for users that is competitive with light rail systems
4. Improve safety along an active, dense, multi-modal corridor 
Sub-project #2: Automation of BlueIndy route from the Airport to Downtown
The second sub-project would be automating a high frequency route of the BlueIndy electric 
car sharing service from the airport to a set station in Indianapolis’ downtown central INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 3business district. The vision is to automate a set number of BlueIndy cars to at least NHTSA 
Level 3 which would allow drivers to experience a high level of autonomous driving while they 
travel from the airport to downtown. 
 
The initial BlueIndy autonomous drive cycle will include a mix of highway and urban roads that 
will showcase the various benefits of autonomous technology like lane change control at high 
speeds, as well as self-parking and speed control in dense urban areas. 
Advantages to automating all electric car sharing (BlueIndy): 
•BlueIndy cars operate in a nodal network on largely set routes (station to station) 
•Seamless technology integration: cars are connected and equipped with GPS and 
   advanced wireless telematics that allows vehicles to be remotely monitored 
•The vehicles, charging stations, rental kiosks, telematics systems, and even insurance are all 
in place and owned and operated by Bolloré Group so there will be fewer technology integra -
tion and legal liability challenges. The Bolloré Group has been a very cooperative 
automotive OEM for the city of Indianapolis. 
Sub-project #3: Airport Shuttle Automation
The Airport Shuttle Automation project would be focused on an immediate implementation 
of a NHTSA Level 4 automation commercial project established and set up in a controlled, 
protected, and safe commercial environment. The goal of this project would be to implement 
a fully autonomous shuttle system using electric buses in a closed loop environment. The 
Indianapolis International Airport currently uses fossil fuel-powered buses to move travelers 
between the airport to the remote parking lots, as well as the many shipping and distribution 
centers surrounding the airport. The parking shuttles operate in fixed routes through the 
parking lots while the shipping companies like FedEx, which has its second largest U.S. hub in 
Indianapolis, move goods between the airport and its distribution centers. 
Sub-project #4: BlueIndy Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) 
Plans for implementing V2G are part of the BlueIndy contract with the city of Indianapolis 
and the telematics and data collection necessary for V2G are already in place. This required 
plan will allow us to use Smart Corridors to eventually deploy a smart grid infrastructure that 
integrates ICT information with the grid to sense and intelligently act on real-time energy flow 
information. Leveraging this study would lay the groundwork for launching the BlueIndy system 
into the portfolio of assets for Indianapolis Power & Light (IPL)/AES supply and demand 
management activities, as well as peak loading conditions. 
To expand on the Grid Frequency Regulation (GFR)/V2G project concepts in Indianapolis, the 
BlueIndy car share system provides ideal conditions for implementing a GFR and V2G systems. 
The 500 electric car share vehicles in the BlueIndy system total a potential of 15 megawatt 
hours of storage capacity. A percentage of this energy storage (i.e., 50 percent, 80 percent, 
etc.) can provide a high level of readiness for bidirectional flow of energy to the electrical grid.  
Private electric vehicle users of the V2G technology would be able to receive credits to their 
Transportation Savings Account through the App described in Element 4.  
Implementation and Operation
On the Red Line project, moving from NHTSA Level 1 to NHTSA Level 4 automation will need 
to be phased in order to ensure safety, reduce financial risk, and optimize service delivery. In 
order to meet the automation goals of the Red Line, technology deployment for full automation 
will be phased to meet the standards of the USDOT, IndyGo, and technology partners. INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 4One drawback to BRT is the ease with which level boarding can be implemented. The proposed 
guidance technology in the first phase of this project will improve service delivery. An example 
of this technology was recently tested on the EmX BRT system in Eugene, Oregon. 
Transportation Challenge Addressed
Automation could directly address the recent DOT estimates in combined cost of over $1 
trillion per year lost through automotive vehicle crashes ($836 billion per year), urban 
congestion ($121 billion), wasted fuel (2.9 billion gallons – cost and GHGs), and time (5.5 
billion hours traffic delay per year)1. The city’s investments have already saved 377 MCO2 and 
BlueIndy’s fleet logged 7,000 trips. If V2G electric car users could take advantage of dynamic 
pricing and save money, electric vehicle use could grow exponentially. These incentives could 
make car ownership possible for residents who previously could not afford it. 
Innovations in engineering, ITS, and automobile design have continued to reduce severe inju -
ry and fatality crashes across the nation. Despite these controls, vehicles continue to be the 
leading cause of death for our young people ages 11 and 16-242. In Indianapolis, the situation 
for pedestrians is especially dire; recently identified as a FHWA Focus City due to 
disproportionately high rate of bicycle and pedestrian fatalities, the number of pedestrian 
fatalities rose significantly from 2014 to 2015. 
Indianapolis Pedestrian Crash Statistics3
      The proposed Smart Corridors are among the 
      largest, most travelled, or highest crash corridors 
      for all users where everyone could most benefits   
      from improved safety through automatic braking   
      and other connected vehicle technologies, 
      potentially reducing crashes by 81 percent4. 
      A Smart Corridor where users, vehicles, and 
      infrastructure interface to warn users or respond 
to movement will be added to Indy’s arsenal of traditional safety measures like improved 
sidewalk infrastructure, lowering design speed, and installing crosswalks and pedestrian 
cues.
1.2 Element 2: ITS Architecture and Real-Time Data Integration
The exponential growth of on demand mobility options like Uber and Lyft have revolutionized 
not only how people travel, but how they access, plan, and pay for transportation. The idea of 
transportation as solely brick and mortar is dissolving and users and operators depend on our 
invisible infrastructure for their daily travel needs. ITS is the foundation of Smart Corridors that 
optimize personal mobility and engage residents while maximizing overall person throughput.
The system would create a “live” transportation model for managing travel demand that 
utilizes user data and intelligent infrastructure. The feedback loop from user data and 
intelligent infrastructure would allow operators to remotely control traffic operations using ITS 
technologies like signal timing, LED lane striping, and signs.

INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 5Operators could remotely control traffic operations and dynamic pricing using ITS technology 
like signal timing, LED lane striping, signs, and the mobile application. Indianapolis’ Smart 
Corridors differ because they can serve as testing grounds for new ITS equipment and to 
establish best practices for pairing existing infrastructure and technologies. 
Implementation and Operation
There are a variety of investments needed to integrate advanced ITS and big data into 
real-time traffic management using a cloud computing system:
The Smart Corridors will require a sophisticated ICT platform and significant investment in 
ITS hardware. This pilot will upgrade Indianapolis’ 20th century ITS infrastructure and require 
a transportation management center (TMC) and staff capable of achieving the desired data 
and operating system integration. The TMC will connect INDOT’s TMC and local emergency 
service and operations providers. Congestion management will initially require an excellent 
timing schedule based on established traffic patterns accounting for time of day and 
eventually integrate real-time information into the traffic management center. Using these 
base models, the connected infrastructure will learn how to autonomously adapt to traffic 
movement. 
Smart Corridors will require monitoring and sophisticated data management and storage 
systems. Currently, traffic monitoring and remote programming is limited on the local 
network. Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) operates a human-in-loop system 
that allows real-time response and will be an excellent example and resource. 
Transportation Challenge Addressed
While the growth of traffic congestion continues to be a major concern for freight and 
passenger transportation nationally, it is not the primary challenge in central Indiana. In fact, 
in 2014 the TomTom Traffic Index ranked Indianapolis the 50th most congested city in 
America, behind many of its peer cities including Columbus, Ohio; Minneapolis, Minn.; 
Denver, Colo.; and Nashville, Tenn.
INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 6With a congestion level at 13 percent, Indianapolis does stand out from many of its peers in 
an important way: the majority of our congestion is disproportionately experienced on local 
roads (23 percent) versus highways (5 percent)5. While nationally vehicle miles traveled 
(VMT) on local roads is outpacing freeway travel which has been declining since 20106, in 
Indianapolis, significant congestion occurs on the local system because we are an “event” 
town. From the Super Bowl to the NCAA Basketball tournament, regional and national 
conferences, Indiana Black Expo, and other events we welcome an estimated 26 million 
visitors annually7. Moving large amounts of people in and out of the downtown is important 
from a security, economic, and user perspective. 
However, transportation management approaches remain lacking; strategies during these 
events range from additional police to roadway closures. Off-ramp and state road signal 
timing is on a time of day control coordinated with Indy’s Department of Public Works (DPW) 
and INDOT (who owns and maintains it) to manage events and rush hour traffic. Real-time 
ITS coordination is limited; by summer 2016 only 230 of Indy’s 1,200 traffic signals will be 
connected by fiber optics. These strategies are no longer possible as downtown Indianapolis 
is evolving from an event location or evening destination to a neighborhood. Since 2008, 
over 5,400 residential units have been completed, with a total investment of about $793 
million in the city7. Big data and ITS offer a promising solution to managing congestion, 
improving air quality, and improving safety. Origin destination information from the user 
application could predict travel behaviors and adjust pricing accordingly and real-time data 
collections will provide information for operators, planners, and the public. As pressure on 
the local system grows, the capital for maintenance, operations, and construction have 
remained level or declined. Real-time data and pricing could provide a new direction in the 
financing, planning, and construction of transportation investments.
 Smart Corridors will help Indy’s “inclusive” goal by building regional assets for residents. By 
providing free public Wi-Fi along these corridors, including the BRT network, residents will be 
able to connect to more resources. The recently completed Alternatives Analysis report for 
the Red Line corridor notes that within a walking distance of the stations, there were 9,200 
low-income households, 3,300 of which did not own an automobile. Over 1,000 Section 8 
units and two major public housing complexes are also within this walking threshold. This 
project will connect these residents and more to information, technology, and mobility 
choices.
1.3 Element 3: User Portal/Mobile Application
Development in Indy favors automobile use; 91.6 percent of people drive to work with 81.8 
percent of them driving alone.8 To decrease VMT, emissions, and improve health outcomes, 
we need to increase multi-modal options and their density. Making these options 
accessible and seamless is a key strategy for realizing mode shift and helps Indy meet its 
goals of a connected, healthy, and inclusive city. The user interface will allow users to safely 
access transportation and connect to the city. We envision an on-demand mobility service 
that enhances personal mobility by integrating all available travel options under a united 
payment platform.

incentives from multi-modal platforms.
The application will reduce congestion by providing economic incentives to providers and 
users through a Transportation Savings Account, similar to health savings account with 
employer or enrollee contributions. Users traveling from point A-B will be able to see real-time 
traffic and incidents, mode choices, etc. while receiving offers to take an alternate modes or 
routes to relieve congestion on the overall system. Key functions of the application include:
• Integrated mode choice and trip chaining capability
• Unified payment platform and cell-phone enabled payment 
• User reporting/crowdsourced data capture
• Dynamic pricing captured through a Transportation Savings Account
• Dynamic routing and real-time availability 
Implementation and Operation
Multiple technology platforms are expanding into mobility app space like RideScout and 
Metropias. Our research partner, from Human Centered Computing in the IU School of 
Informatics and Computing will lead the user experience and user interface elements for 
the Smart Corridor. The Smart Corridor app may include modifications to existing platforms 
or the development of a new open source model that can be maintained and improved by 
the private sector. Important to the features and functionality of the app is tailoring the data 
collection and processing to inform transportation security, planning, and operations. 
Allowing users and operators to view real-time data and engage will create the synergy 
needed for innovative transportation management. Other features could include community 
information for current locations like median housing costs, schools, etc. – advertising 
opportunities could be a substantial part of the financial sustainability for app maintenance.
Transportation Challenge Addressed
Smart cities mean connected, engaged citizens. While transportation choices and 
operators are quickly multiplying, public awareness and access to these options can be 
invisible. People are unable to evaluate the competitiveness of each mode and make choices 
based on what is best for their overall needs. The Smart Corridor app makes mobility seam -
less, accessible, and offers incentives for those who live car-free or are transit dependent 
helping Indy become more inclusive. The platform allows user reported safety concerns to 
inform investments and improve response times. This information will be integrated into our 
asset management program and help prioritize investments. By engaging and connecting our 
residents around the infrastructure that supports them, we improve mobility for everyone. 
The app catalyzes the growth of ride-sharing or car-lite options and will improving air quality 
by reducing emissions for the region. 
INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 81.4 Element 4: Live Modeling Traffic Modeling and Dynamic Trip Pricing
Dynamic pricing is a method to allow market forces to respond to peaks and valleys in supply 
or demand for a product or service.  Each industry takes a slightly different approach to 
repricing based on its needs and the demand for the product. Similar to the Octopus 
model in Hong Kong, Indianapolis will use dynamic pricing across the transportation sector 
to reduce congestion and more efficiently use our transportation system. The user app will 
connect to a transportation savings account (TSA) that provides economic incentives for trips 
that lower emissions like ride-sharing, electric vehicles, or bicycling. Since transportation 
demand exceeds funding and without a system of toll collection, we have little opportunity to 
directly use dynamic pricing in the traditional sense. Therefore, we propose to focus on two 
proxies through the user app – transit and parking – which will be expanded to include all 
modes after initial deployment.
Dynamic pricing in parking has recently made waves based on pioneering work on on-street 
parking by Donald Shoup.  Indianapolis proposes to employ this model of dynamic pricing 
across the downtown area for both the on-street parking as well as the privately owned 
parking garages.  The goal is to manage demand on our roadways.  The partnership with 
private garages will allow parking costs across all of downtown to fluctuate with time into and 
out of the garage, encouraging drivers to travel at non-peak hours whenever possible. In the 
larger context of an entire transportation system, transit is better equipped to handle large 
spikes in demand than most other modes of transport, and cities should encourage as much 
travel as possible be made by transit during peak hours.  Therefore, Indianapolis is proposing 
to incentivize transit travel during those peak periods by lowering  the cost of the fare.  For 
example, a regular bus fare may be $1.75 each way, but if a rider boards during the peak 
time frame, the fare is only $0.75.  Users will be incentivized to use different modes by 
providing discounted rates.
In the future this pricing model could track the “true” costs or estimates of infrastructure 
to users using data analytics from multiple agencies to aid in data-driven decision making. 
When planning or evaluating projects, the city could evaluate this use and cost data to help 
prioritize investments.
This mock-up highlights the menu on the left and color coded real-time traffic scenario. The same image can 
show bike routes, BlueIndy car parking/charging stations, etc.
INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 9Synergies Lead to Data-driven Decision-making and Smart Investments
The Smart Corridor user application would incentivize routing based on mode and provide a 
captive audience or optimal modal mix for new technologies. Can vehicle throughput be 
maximized if all variables are controlled (signals, flow, etc.)? Is separated bicycle 
infrastructure alone the best investment for reducing bicycle crashes or does connected 
vehicle technology (V2I) need to be installed to maximize its benefits? In a corridor with real 
time information on personal experience (dynamic pricing, happiness based on social 
media/user experience survey, travel time); existing conditions (traffic, travel demand 
behaviors, crash information); infrastructure costs/impact (budget expenditure, 
infrastructure life cycle maintenance and operations costs), environmental impact 
(air quality, emissions, and infrastructure wear), how will the public choose how to travel?
Implementation and Operation
Clearly, this transit incentive program would result in lost revenue for the transit agency.  
However, the pairing of the parking and transit programs would allow the additional fees 
collected for peak hour parking to be used to offset the lost revenue to the transit agency, 
making the overall program sustainable.  This program would require a significant 
investment in sensors to monitor real-time demand, communications systems to notify 
drivers and users of changing costs, and sophisticated fare collection systems for both 
parking garages and the transit fleet.  This Smart Cities grant would be used to build out that 
infrastructure necessary to implement the plan.
We will develop the dynamic pricing model using regression analysis as such a model can 
establish relationship between predictors such as distance, traffic patterns, and predicting 
the response variable, the average fare at a given time. One possible approach would be to 
use multiple linear regression model, y=b_0+ b_1x+...+ b_nxn+i, where y is the predicted 
fare at a given time; b0 is the base fare; and b1 through bn represent coefficients of 
predictor variables that are chosen such as distance, traffic, demand, etc. And in order to tie 
in the mission of promoting a smart city, we could include a negative coefficient on a 
variable(s) that indicate the level of environmental preservation. 
Dynamic pricing offers exciting opportunities to test behavior, travel patterns, and emission 
reduction strategies. The system could support the expansion of car-pooling through the 
Central Indiana Regional Transportation Authority (CIRTA) by implementing choice 
recommendations from Deloitte University’s Smart Mobility Report9 like providing financial 
incentivize for car-pooling providers or on-demand commercial providers to increase their 
number of shared rides. Data could lead to infrastructure investments that support 
ride-sharing, like HOV lanes along Smart Corridors or reserving prime parking to incentivize 
cleaner transportation options. 
Indianapolis will update its zoning code to allow and support shared transportation facilities 
on public and private property to remove institutional barriers that discourage on-demand 
and shared mobility services and use.

Challenge Addressed: Transportation Gap and Economic Mobility
The USDOT identified Indianapolis as a pilot site for the LadderSTEP program. The Red Line 
BRT investment will connect thousands of job and residents and serve as a building block 
for improving the economic mobility of residents. LadderSTEP serves to catalyze construction 
and focus on building connections, workforce capacity, and supporting revitalization.
Smart Corridors would build on this effort by supporting mobility options while providing 
discounted fare during peak commuting hours. Working with employers to establish TSAs 
and increase shared mobility choices, Smart Corridors will provide greater access to 
economic opportunity to residents. Next to housing, transportation costs are often the 
second highest cost burden placed on an average household. In Indianapolis, the housing 
and transportation costs for most residents are 46 percent of their income10. By supporting 
the sharing economy and diversifying trip options through open source data and policy 
incentives, we are improving mobility for all City of Indianapolis residents. This model could 
allow the city to set and price VMT reduction goals once patterns are established on the cost 
of emission reduction and individual choice. 
2.0 Indianapolis: Characteristics of a USDOT Smart City
Indianapolis is a consolidated city-county with a 2014 population estimate of 934,243 
residents11.  However, portions of the county are known as excluded cities and retain 
substantial political and administrative powers, and the portion of the population in 
Indianapolis proper (known as “Indianapolis, city balance” in Census terms) is estimated at 
848,78812.  Unlike many of its rust-belt peers, Indianapolis continues to grow, and has done 
so throughout its history.

12 U.S. Census Bureau.  http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/18/1836003.html
INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 11This growth can largely be attributed to the city-county consolidation, which captured four 
decades of population and tax base growth.  While Indy has grown, consolidation disguised 
the disinvestment and abandonment of the urban core (known as Center Township), which 
has lost 59% of its population since the peak in 1950.  The exciting opportunity is, like many 
cities, Indy’s urban core is on the rebound.  According to Census figures, over the past six 
years, Center Township has grown for the first time since 1950, and the most urbanized 
portions of Central Indiana (all of which are in Indy) are the only places growing faster since 
2010 than they were before. 
On the economic front, the national decline in manufacturing hit Indy later than many 
cities.  Since 2003, Indy lost nearly 19,000 manufacturing jobs, stripping many families and 
entire neighborhoods of their economic purpose.  Recent research from Harvard’s Equality 
of Opportunity Project shows Indy ranks 48 among the largest 50 American cities in terms of 
economic mobility13, and research from the Brookings Institute showing that the Indy metro 
area has seen an 81.7% increase in poverty, one of the fastest growth rates in the nation14.  
As accessible jobs left neighborhoods, new jobs have emerged much farther away, meaning 
families typically take a pay cut for a lower-level job while increasing transportation costs just 
to get there.  This is one reason the U.S. DOT selected Indy to participate in the Ladders of 
Opportunity program (LadderSTEP) and why Indy city leaders have focused, and continue to 
do so in this application, in promoting more robust transportation choices that improve 
residents’ access to economic opportunities throughout the region.
In 2002, Marion County accounted for just 2.7 percent of the region’s population growth. But 
over the course of the next ten years, Marion County consistently captured an ever-increasing 
share, rising to 41 percent of the metropolitan area’s growth in 2012. These trends mirror 
those that have been observed in other highly-competitive metropolitan areas. Over the last 
25 years, we’ve had more than $12.5 billion in investment in downtown.
3.0 Other Smart City Characteristics
Indianapolis’ Smart City Infrastructure
In the spirit of Indianapolis’ successful history of large-scale infrastructure improvements 
and economic investments, IndyGo is currently pursuing the Red Line Rapid Transit project. 
The Red Line will be the first all-electric BRT in the nation and the first rapid transit service in 
Indiana. The complete line is envisioned as a 35-mile BRT corridor, to be completed in three 
phases first of which is in the Indianapolis Regional Center (downtown and vicinity). The Red 
Line will serve as the backbone to the planned regional transit network, connecting 
neighborhoods from all walks of life, universities, and other major commercial hubs through 
the downtown urban core of the city. While operating in its own lane, along a dedicated route 
with traffic control technologies and frequent stops, this eBRT system is ideal for developing 
autonomous vehicle technologies.

14 The Growth and Spread of Concentrated Poverty. http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/2014/
concentrated-poverty#/M26900. INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 12Indianapolis has been at the forefront of the transportation electrification movement for a 
number of years. Energy Systems Network (ESN), a non-profit organization headquartered 
in Indianapolis, has been focused on accelerating the energy technology sector since 2009, 
when it launched an initiative called Project Plug-IN. ESN gathered partners from a variety of 
industries and backgrounds to work together to begin a deployment of electric vehicle and 
smart grid technologies in central Indiana. Using this approach, Project Plug-IN launched 
nearly 200 charging stations in central Indiana by 2011. Those initial deployment efforts led 
to the growth in electrified transportation detailed below.
In early 2014, the city of Indianapolis contracted with French multinational conglomerate 
the Bolloré Group to provide and build out a fully electric car sharing service in Indianapolis. 
Launched publicly in September 2015, the system has accrued over 1,000 members in the 
first four months of operation and logged more than 7,000 trips with 60 operable stations. 
The system will continue to build out through 2016 and will finish with a planned 200 
stations (five charging stations each) and 500 cars for a total of 1,000 charging stations 
capable of 13 MWh of storage.
In 2013, the City of Indianapolis entered into an agreement to deploy up to 425 plug-in 
sedans in the city’s fleet replacing older, less efficient gas-only vehicles. Today there are 
more than 225 plug-in cars deployed, giving the City of Indianapolis one of the largest fleets 
of plug-in vehicles in the nation. Each car is saving the city approximately $2,000 per year 
in avoided fuel and maintenance costs. This has resulted in over 42,300 gallons of gasoline 
and 377 MTCO2 saved. Further savings can be gained by utilizing automated safety systems 
on the vehicles to reduce chances of accidents as well as leveraging the large cumulative 
energy storage capacity of the vehicles as a whole through a holistic, integrated systems 
approach with the grid and built environment.
An Environment Conducive to Smart Corridors
The Red Line is one part of a significant rethinking of what an Indianapolis transit system 
should be and demonstrates how Indy’s environment is conducive to implementing the 
Smart Corridor project.  For over five years, the Indianapolis region has been working on a 
transit vision, dubbed Indy Connect.  In early 2016, IndyGo will be unveiling the first step in 
Indy Connect, a five-year implementation plan to improve the transit system in the core city of 
Indianapolis. This plan would be put to the public as a referendum in November 2016.  This 
planning process has deliberately made the choice of deploying new resources into areas 
of highest density and ridership potential rather than attempting to cover more area.  Key 
components of the plan include Red, Blue and Purple Rapid transit lines and significantly 
enhanced local service with more frequency, improved travel time, and extended night and 
weekend hours.INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 13Committed Leadership
Indy’s leadership is committed to Smart Corridors and long term strategies for improving the 
region as Plan 2020 demonstrated. Smart Corridors is informed by Plan 2020, a pioneering 
planning process to define the next century for the city that has been driven by an 
extraordinary team of nearly 200 community leaders.  The plan is a collaboration between 
the Greater Indianapolis Progress Committee, Department of Metropolitan Development 
(DMD), DPW, the Indy Chamber, and community leaders to make Indianapolis a better place 
to live, work and visit. The Plan 2020 initiative includes a visionary yet strategic Bicentennial 
Plan for Indianapolis as well as updates to six local government plans.
Commitment to Smarter Land Use & Affordable Housing
Indy’s ability to maximize transportation investments has been the key to the success of 
many large scale projects. IndyGo’s Red Line BRT system will connect hundreds of 
thousands of jobs and community members. To maximize this investment and housing 
security for all residents along 
the route, the City is adopting 
Transit Oriented Development 
(TOD) overlays to support 
appropriate land use, zoning, 
and development.
INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 14The TOD Strategic Plan, produced by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Planning Organization 
(MPO) supports community development that includes a mixture of housing, office, retail and 
city living amenities integrated into a walkable neighborhood and located within a half-mile 
of quality public transportation to increase accessibility to jobs. This year the City will expand 
on both of these efforts, developing a neighborhood housing strategy for the entire 
County that uses data-driven inputs to coordinate public, non-profit, philanthropic, and 
private sector community development investment, as well as a new county-wide land use 
plan that includes a focus on increasing density in select villages, introducing transit-oriented 
development, and connecting land use recommendations to adequate public infrastructure. 
This work will ultimately set the stage for new mixed-use district zoning categories provided 
by Indy’s new zoning ordinance, IndyRezone.
Similar to many U.S. metropolitans, Indy’s existing transportation infrastructure requires 
greater investment capital than the operation and maintenance budget will allow. In spite of 
this, Indianapolis continues to spend less per capita than many of our peer cities 
approximately $50 million annually or $125,000 per square mile15 and ranks near the 
bottom in terms of investment in our public transportation system.
        IndyGo is currently funded primarily 
        with property taxes.  However, in 
        recent years, the state of Indiana 
        instituted a cap on the percent of 
        assessed value that can be 
        captured in a tax, essentially 
        capping IndyGo revenues to grow 
        only with the growth in property 
        values, preventing any growth in our 
        service.  Therefore, in November 
        2016, IndyGo is pursuing a 
        referendum to direct a portion of 
        income taxes to the agency.
        The developing referendum 
        demonstrates the political and 
        community commitment to 
        increasing mobility options.
Commitment to Sharing Economy
Indiana’s low-regulatory environment and the growing tech cluster in Central Indiana have 
benefited the sharing economy.  A commitment to the sharing economy is evidenced by the 
inclusion of the topic in the Plan 2020 initiative’s Bicentennial Agenda, the vision and values 
component of the Comprehensive Plan for Indianapolis and Marion County.  In the 
transportation options portion of the vision, “continue to create an environment that 
supports the sharing economy including car and bike sharing” is listed as a must-do activity.

 “We must produce an environment where the sharing of ideas and resources across 
 industries fuels our future economy. We must ensure that our virtual connectivity is 
 not only at a competitive capacity but accessible to all. We must support civic 
 advancement and new business by sharing data, allowing both the public and private 
 sectors to create new applications and find new solutions. This ensures a government 
 that is communicating internally and externally, providing opportunities for efficiencies 
 and transparency.”
One of the first regional data portals in the nation was recently launched to facilitate data 
flows across political boundaries, and the State of Indiana’s Management and Performance 
Hub and Transparency Portal provide tremendous platforms for broader data-driven 
management decisions.  For policing, Indianapolis just opened the Real-Time Data Center, a 
hub that connects patrol-level information, city-wide surveillance cameras, and data 
analytics to respond to and predict evolving criminal patterns.  This focus on data-driven 
decision making in the largest department in city government is itself the outgrowth of a 
Code for America fellowship program that added transparency to police complaints, 
officer-involved shootings, and use of force through the Project Comport program, which is 
now integrated into the Regional Data Portal.
The region’s commitment to open data is broader than simply the public sector, however.  
The Open Indy Brigade, a Code for America brigade, has been a driving force in civic data, 
including Plan 2020 and the regional data portal.  A diverse and growing tech sector, 
anchored by global names like Salesforce (ExactTarget), Interactive Intelligence, Angie’s List, 
and award-winning start-ups like Rook Security and TinderBox, provides a rich pool of talent 
to support civic data.  This private-sector commitment is also evident at the Indy Chamber, 
who is actively involved in sponsoring hack-a-thons focusing on improving government 
efficiency and supporting the ideas of the Plan 2020 vision.

INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 16INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 175.0 Alignment with USDOT’s 12 Vision Element
Element 1: Urban Automation
Indy’s Smart Corridor approach to urban automation (UA) is building automated all-electric 
BRT, airport shuttle, and car share supported by smart infrastructure. This urban platform or 
“sandbox” offers an historical opportunity to accelerate the integration of the nation’s largest 
and most advanced electric car sharing and eBRT systems with cutting edge automation and 
connected vehicle technologies in an environment that will reach millions of consumers.
Investing in UA technology across mobility options can reduce operational costs to providers 
and connected infrastructure can relay improved safety information. Deployment of NHTSA 
Level 3 automation on BlueIndy car share vehicles will realize cost savings due to the 
existing technology systems. Integrating autonomous technology into the BlueIndy system 
can occur seamlessly as the vehicles are already operating in an intelligent, connected, and 
monitored system.  Automated eBRT will be tied into signal timing to improve congestion 
along the corridor, and Wi-Fi connections will be provided to users that can collect 
information to evaluate system performance, improve access, and increase safety. 
Examples of technology and solutions available from corporate partners AT&T, IBM, & 
Ericsson to implement this include:
• Connected Vehicle Cloud that integrates with an ITS package
• Transformation Services to help integrate standalone applications to transform data into 
    information for real-time interworking and intelligent insight across applications and 
    organizations.
• Data Analytics to enable controlled access and use of data from cellular and 
non-cellular devices, creating value through cross-industry use of data. 
Element 2: Connected Vehicles
Smart Corridors will provide the ICT structure to allow users and vehicles and infrastructure 
to “talk” to one another and each other. Communications technology solutions proposed 
include:
• Installation of free Wi-Fi along Smart Corridors 
• Wireless transmission media (i.e. Dedicated short range communications DSRC)
• Cellular data sharing
Connected to the Internet of Things (IoT), drivers can choose alternative routes or parking by 
using data analytics and routing information (optimized by the user application). Connected 
vehicle technology could revolutionize safety of all roadway users. Smart-sensor based 
infrastructure could improve safety by holding signals for pedestrians crossing the street or 
warn connected vehicles of bicyclists in their blind spot.
 
V2I technology could send existing data streams to allow operators to identify infrastructure 
problems or gaps and emergency management personnel to respond to hazards or detect 
crashes in real time. In response to incidents or potential hazards like weather, connected 
technology could allow transportation management centers TMCs to automatically reroute 
trucks or vehicles carrying hazardous materials onto appropriate corridors by sending 
information to in-car controllers. V2I solutions deployed along the Red Line will save costs as 
these corridors have planned roadwork and intersection redesigns. Research partner IUPUI’s 
current relevant projects include 1) Integrating vehicle to vehicle communication and pe -
destrian autonomous emergency braking and 2) Development of Pedestrian/bicyclist Crash 
Scenarios and Vehicle Performance Testing.INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 18Element 3: Intelligent, Sensor-Based Infrastructure
Sensors in infrastructure could alert operators during congestion events and reroute users 
via the mobile app to alternative routes or modes. Technology solutions proposed to support 
Smart Infrastructure include integrated sensors, processors and wireless transmitters for 
data capture on existing conditions and environmental information (e.g. pavement markers, 
lighting, bus stop, and crosswalks). The pilot Smart Corridors have planned infrastructure 
work in the short term including ITS upgrades and intersection redesigns so their installation 
can be coordinated with the current project work saving project costs.
Element 4: Urban Analytics
A large amount of dynamic, real-time data will be generated from traffic monitoring sensors 
and vehicle location and schedule information. A team of faculty from the IU School of 
Informatics & Computing and Purdue School of Science, Department of Computer Science 
are partners on this project. This data will undergo pre-analytics to clean, integrate structure, 
store and secure. For this pre-analytics stage, we will develop and implement various data 
management and data security algorithms that will work on large real-time streaming data. 
Research partner IUPUI’s current relevant projects include 1) TrafficAnalyzer: A Real-time 
Traffic Stream Processing and Analyzing System, Supported by IBM and 2) Development of 
Key Technologies for Big Data Analysis and Management Software Based on Next 
Generation Memory, Supported by ETRI.
Element 5: User Focused Mobility Services and Choices
The Smart Corridor on-demand mobility service will all available travel options under a united 
payment platform that offer economic incentives for trips that reduce emissions. Once 
deployed, this system could reduce cost to operators for maintaining separate payment 
systems and user applications. Revenue generated from dynamic pricing could support 
ongoing maintenance and operation of the application or be applied to projects identified 
through crowdsourced data. 
Element 6: Urban Delivery and Logistics
By piloting automated vehicle technology and V2I, Indy could optimize freight routes on our 
system. The Indianapolis MPO is finishing a regional freight study that prioritizes local arterial 
and state systems as key freight corridors. Using ICT, TMCs could channel freight vehicles to 
priority corridors by communicating with drivers or alert them of weight and height 
restrictions.
Element 7: Strategic Business Models and Partnering
In addition to the core team members for this application, ESN has also assembled a 
world-class team of global leaders in connected mobility and automation. This group includes 
members from: AES, Bolloré Group, BOSCH, Clemson University International Center for 
Automotive Research (CU-ICAR), Delphi Automotive, Duke Energy, Indiana Department of 
Transportation, Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles, Indianapolis Power & Light, Purdue 
University, Toshiba, TechAssure, and Transportation Active Safety Institute (TASI). Each of 
these partners is committed to working with ESN and the City of Indianapolis to plan, 
execute, and report on the nation’s most advanced ecosystem of multi-modal electrified, 
connected, autonomous vehicles through the Indianapolis Smart Corridors initiative.  INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 19Employers and universities in Indianapolis, as in many cities, provide on-demand parallel 
transportation through bus or van services for their residents, students and employees. The 
maintenance, operation, and capital expenditure for these closed loop systems is high while 
provide little to no support to regional mobility. If these system operators could incentivize 
their consumers to connect to existing ride-share options while ensuring user safety, these 
systems could be phased out or generate income by providing rides through an on-demand 
ride model.
Element 8: Smart Grid, Roadway Electrification, and Electric Vehicles
Deployment of Indy’s smart grid solutions will have significant cost savings by leveraging 
existing electrified infrastructure and investment. Implementing V2G capability can help 
providers manage electric demand and allow consumers to participate in peak shaving. 
Indianapolis will have 15 MWh of energy storage connected to the grid through a single 
customer once this program is completed.V2G technology and wireless charging capabilities 
could tap into the dynamic pricing model. Not only would wireless charging help reduce peak 
electric demand, but the application could electric vehicle users could capitalize by taking 
advantage of surge pricing within the app while the vehicle is stopped or parked. 
Element 9: Connected, Involved Citizens
Providing open, accessible data in a user-friendly format will allow residents to discover 
innovative applications of that information. The user application could connect citizens to 
crowdsourced reporting applications and community information. For example, if a user is 
traveling along a street, they could connect to local historical sites, take a guided tour, 
access popular restaurants, and access city information. 
Element 10: Architecture and Standards
Smart Corridors will use all existing standards, systems, and processes approved for 
connected vehicles and ITS systems. The partnership with IUPUI will allow us to integrate 
these systems with other city systems which may include police navigation, emergency 
medical services, and weather stations. For example, a flood forecasted by weather outlets 
could link to the city’s impervious surface map, detect high risk areas and dispatch 
responders to those locations for evacuation. All existing tools including CVRIA, National ITS 
Architecture and other ITS standards to model this integration and deployment. Indy’s 
approach and partnership with a major research institution will allow for training and 
deployment across the country.
Element 11: Low-cost, Efficient, Resilient Information and Communications Technology
One of the most important factors in the proposed mobile smart city is the collection and 
processing of huge dynamic sensor and vehicle data. We will design integrated security 
architecture and develop a resilient secure system that will enable the secure data 
collection, transportation, storage, management and processing of smart city data. This 
system will provide one common operating platform to inform the city’s data-driven decision 
making. In detail, we propose and will develop 1) Secure sensor and vehicular data collection 
and aggregation 2) Secure and integral data transmission and 3) Access control and 
controlled data sharing.INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 20Element 12: Smart Land Use through Connected Infrastructure
Indy’s adoption of TOD overlays and affordability strategies to support appropriate land use, 
zoning, and development demonstrates our commitment to increasing density and improving 
housing choice. The TOD Strategic Plan supports community development that includes a 
mixture of housing, office, retail and city living amenities integrated into a walkable 
neighborhood and located within a half-mile of quality public transportation to increase 
accessibility to jobs.
The Smart Corridor project will allow us to take this focus a step further- analytics will allow 
us to evaluate mode mix by land use and transportation options to prioritize investments 
and provide optimal mobility choices. Additionally, smart infrastructure like roadway sensors 
could detect where cars are driving so we can reserve more realistic right-of-way for projects 
or allocated unused space to bicycle infrastructure, sidewalks, or HOV lanes.
6.0 Risk Identification & Solutions
Data integration is a fundamental, yet challenging, component of this Smart Corridor model. 
The data integration system will combine various types of data including geographic location, 
speed, count, and behavior patterns, from multiple sources into integrated sets and provide 
users with a unified view of these data. In this project, we will incorporate both batch-
oriented techniques for query performance and real-time data integration to eliminate the 
annoyance of out-of-date data. We will use both batch-oriented technique such as extraction, 
transformation, and loading (ETL) and popular real-time techniques such as Data Federation. 
 
Dynamic pricing and e-payments require providers to have integrated systems, payment 
platforms, and an agreed upon price structure. Financial structures and reserves will be 
established to ensure providers cash flow and fare box recovery is not too disrupted during 
deployment. A financial institution will be identified to manage the transportation savings 
accounts and ensure financial stability in the long term. Additionally, users without bank 
accounts or credit access must be able to use the system. 
Creating a TMC and upgrading to a shared-use platform will require detailed roles and 
responsibilities, maintenance plans, and dedicated ongoing funding sources in cooperation 
with technology partners. The upgrade and deployment of ITS infrastructure will require an 
integrated work plan with the Red Line and detailed traffic pattern information to establish 
baseline system management. 
Creating a digital interface requires we ensure participation from all users like people 
without cell phone access, visual impairments, and older adults. By working with community 
foundations, advocacy groups, and others, Indy will create programs to ensure Smart 
Corridors are accessible to all through education, subsidies, or integrated technology 
programs. INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 217.0 Partners and Stakeholders
Plan 2020 captured the values and goals for Indy. Equally important, it created the 
partnerships with major institutions and engaged them in thinking about a dynamic future. It 
financed innovative projects and research and provided opportunities for young community 
members to apply their talents to solving Indy’s challenges and finding opportunities.  Lead 
by Indy’s Department of Metropolitan Development , this Smart Cities Coalition was made 
possible by this foundational project.
The City of Indianapolis’ Department of Public Works (DPW)  builds and maintains public 
infrastructure, park land, manages solid waste collection and the city’s entire fleet—striving 
always to provide effective, efficient customer service to citizens and visitors to Indianapolis, 
Marion County and ensuring a healthy, safe, and natural environment.
The faculty and researchers from Indiana University Bloomington and Indiana University 
Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI)  will be collaborating on all four major aspects of 
the proposed Smart Corridor project. This unique partnership will ensure the evaluation and 
replicability of the Smart Corridor approach and technology. The Indiana University is a major 
multi-campus public research institution, grounded in the liberal arts and sciences, and a 
world leader in professional, medical, and technological education. The IUPUI campus, with 
over 26,000 students, is adjacent to downtown Indianapolis. The Indiana University School 
of Informatics and Computing  is the first completely new school in the United States 
devoted exclusively to Informatics and a range of its sub-disciplines. With its formative 
national role in creating the nation’s largest Informatics Program on the Bloomington and 
Indianapolis campuses, the School is the broadest and one of the largest information/
computing schools in the U.S. The Purdue University School of Engineering and Technology  
at IUPUI working on project’s autonomous vehicle element offers cutting-edge academics 
and a research catalyst. These centers are focused on solving some of the world’s most 
pressing challenges in areas such as health care, energy, and transportation, while 
educating a technically savvy workforce. This team has a wealth of expertise in this area, as 
evidenced by the Transportation Active Safety Institute’s (TASI)  success. TASI’s goal is to 
partner with university, industry and government to conduct research and development in 
advanced active safety technologies, and perform evaluation and assessment of active 
safety systems. TASI has many faculties and full time researchers with expertise from 
electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, human factor engineering, medicine, and 
public policy.
Successful implementation of the Element 1: Commercial Integration of Autonomous and 
Connected Vehicle Technology will require a diverse set of experienced and committed 
partners from industry, academia, and government. Fortunately, headquartered in 
Indianapolis, is Energy Systems Network (ESN)  – a unique non-profit organization led by 
a board of CEOs and presidents of several of the world’s largest energy and transportation 
companies. Their mission is to “leverage ESN’s global network of renowned thought leaders, 
and provide integrated, energy, economic, and environmental solutions with the “capacity to 
endure” for improving the quality of life for all people.” ESN is highly focused on developing 
and implementing public-private partnerships in the alternative energy technology sector as 
demonstrated by leadership in Project Plug-IN™ resulting in more than $60 million invested 
in plug-in electric vehicle projects in Indianapolis. This work has all been accomplished by 
drawing on the technical, operations, finance, and policy expertise of a network of global 
thought leaders coordinated by ESN.INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 21Delphi Automotive  is a leading global technology company of automotive and commercial 
vehicle markets. Delphi delivers solutions that help make vehicles safe, green, and 
connected. Its product lines range including the automotive industry, commercial vehicle 
industry, testing services, commercializing and licensing disruptive technologies, and others. 
Of significant interest to the Smart Corridor project is Delphi’s wide range of active safety 
technologies, such as intelligent cameras, sensors, lane departure warning systems and 
parking guidance systems. With Delphi’s support, the best-of-class technologies will enhance 
the vehicle automation pilots in Element 1.
Local utility support integration of a project of this scale is critical in ensuring full system 
integration. Indianapolis Power & Light is the local utility for the Indianapolis area (Marion 
County) to more than 480,000 residential, commercial, and industrial customers. IPL has 
been a leader in EV infrastructure readiness as the first utility to offer time-of-use (TOU) rates 
to incentivize EV usage in homes and businesses in 2011. In addition to deploying public EV 
charging infrastructure, they are a key partner in preparing the grid for the deployment of 
charging stations for the BlueIndy car sharing service.
The City and partners will be working with the support of the Smart Cities Alliance . AT&T 
Mobility LLC (“AT&T”), Ericsson Inc. (“Ericsson”) and the International Business Machines 
Corporation (“IBM”). The members of the Smart City Alliance, together with our other 
vendors, strategic relationships, consultants and subcontractors, will be able to deliver a 
comprehensive solution as well as the execution experience necessary to deploy projects of 
this magnitude.
The Smart Corridors’ success relies on the coordination and cooperation of all local and 
state-wide transportation partners. IndyGo , a key implementing partner for multiple 
technology solutions, is the largest public transit agency in the state of Indiana. Their 
leadership in developing an electric bus fleet and other innovations continues to improve the 
health of our community.
The Indianapolis MPO  is the regional entity that plans and programs federal transportation 
funds for highways, transit, non-motorized transportation, and other means of moving people 
and goods. The MPO works within federal transportation requirements to guide the 
development of a multi-modal transportation system within the Metropolitan Planning Area 
(MPA).
The Chamber’s leadership in public transportation and leveraging investments through 
public-private partnerships will be vital to this programs’ broad coalition and financial 
sustainability. The  Indy Chamber  serves as a voice of progress and improvement in the 
region, uniting business and community to maintain a strong economy and quality of life, 
representing roughly 2,000 members and their 200,000+ employees. It provides 
membership functions and serves as the lead regional economic development entity. 
The BlueIndy electric car sharing service is another key partner by serving as a test case for 
vehicle automation. The vehicles are already equipped with much of the necessary 
technology and communications systems that allow for a smoother transition to a level of 
automation that would work well for a key route: The Indianapolis International Airport to the 
downtown area.INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 23The project’s success will require a broad coalition that can plan, implement, market, fund, 
and evaluate the Smart Corridor model. We’ve identified the stakeholders below as key 
partners of our broader coalition and will continue to seek their official support.
INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 248.0 Existing Transportation Infrastructure & System Features
Indianapolis’ local roadway network is based on a traditional grid with a highway ring serving 
surrounding neighborhoods around a downtown core known as the Mile Square. The local

Despite the City of Indianapolis being the 12th largest city in the United States (U.S. Bureau 
of the Census, 2010), IndyGo ranks 101st of transit systems in terms of passenger-miles 
travelled. IndyGo is the primary provider of public transportation in the Indianapolis region. 
Its service includes 31 local routes and a county-wide paratransit service serving 10.5 
million passenger trips annually. 
Shared-use mobility services 
     From 2008 to 2015, Indianapolis went from 0 to 90 
     miles of bike lanes and separated infrastructure and 
     over 70 miles of trails and greenways. The last eight 
     years have also included the launch of Pacer Bikeshare 
     system, creation of the bicycle commuter hub downtown, 
     and the passage of a comprehensive complete streets 
     ordinance. The Indianapolis Cultural Trail is an eight-mile 
     world-class separated urban bike and pedestrian path   
     in downtown Indianapolis that connects neighborhoods,
     cultural districts and entertainment amenities while 
     serving as the downtown hub for central Indiana’s vast   
     greenway system.
In early 2014, the city of Indianapolis contracted with the Bolloré Group to provide, build, 
and operate America’s largest fully electric car sharing service in Indianapolis. Launched in 
September 2015, the $50 million system has over 1,000 members in the first four service 
months logging more than 7,000 trips with only 120 electric cars and 300 charging stations 
at 60 sites which will expand in 2016. Indy is also served by major point-to-point shared use 
mobility providers including Uber and Lyft.
Information and communication technology 
There are 230 traffic signals, primarily located in the core CBD, currently interconnected via 
fiber optic cable.  The system allows real-time monitoring and manipulation of timing plans 
via a web-based platform.  A substantial investment has been made over the past three 
years to repair and upgrade the original system installed in the late 1990’s.  An $800,000 
conduit and fiber optic repair project was recently completed, and DPW Operations 
continues to replace $1.4 million in traffic signal controller and cabinet hardware. This 
project is scheduled to be completed summer 2016. The original fiber optic network has 
been damaged and cut due to utility work, demolition, and construction. This next 
generation of fiber optic infrastructure investment will need to be closely monitored and 
enforced through the Department of Code Enforcement (DCE).
Intelligent Transportation Systems (TMC and field equipment) 
ITS have been applied throughout the greater Indianapolis area for many years to promote 
the safe and efficient travel of motorists, transit riders, and cargo.  A majority of the ITS 
infrastructure belongs to INDOT and is utilized along the interstates. Indianapolis TMC is 
owned and operated by INDOT and is co-located with state police, allowing for seamless 
roadway incident management and response. They maintain a sophisticated ITS and data 
management system. Despite state-of-the-art technology and system monitoring on the 
highways, Indianapolis’ ITS deployment is slowly upgrading from legacy systems installed in 
the 1980s and 1990s. Indianapolis Cultural Tra il:

non-interconnected signals, closed loop signal systems, and in the central business district 
(CBD) interconnected signals. Non-Interconnected Signals are either coordinated using 
time-based coordination or are too far from any adjacent traffic signal to benefit from any 
signal progression plan.  Of the 1,200 traffic signals approximately 498 (or 42 percent) fall 
under this category. Closed Loop Signal System interconnected via copper, fiber, or radio and 
allows limited remote manipulation of the traffic signals.  Of all our traffic signals, 472 fall 
under this category.  There are currently 54 closed loop systems. Fall Creek Parkway, a major 
urban arterial, also features variable lanes that shift based on time of day to accommodate 
rush hour congestion.
9.0 Data Collection, Sharing, and Management
Information Services Agency (ISA) provides data management and services to the city and 
serves as the central information hub. While there is a centralized resource, current 
transportation data collection efforts and distribution vary department to department. 
Development of a public information portal where residents can access zoning, parcel, and 
right of way information is currently underway. Data collected by the city and partners 
includes:
• Asset management data (pavement condition)
• Pedestrian and bicycle count data (via sensors and manual collection)
• Transportation plan implementation data (for evaluation)
• Vehicle counts on local roads and federal system
• Crash data (ARIES system based on police reports)
• IndyGo security cameras and passenger counters
• BlueIndy origin-destination information and number of trips
• Pacers Bikeshare trips, mileage, carbon-offset
The format of the city data collected varies; some are converted to geospatial data while 
others are maintained in separate software systems or spreadsheets. All mapped data in 
ArcGIS shapefiles are managed and maintained by ISA on a shared server available to any 
city department. The MPO’s count information is available through INDOT’s interactive 
mapping website.  Outside of the city government, data sharing processes are less formal. 
Public transit count information is aggregated and shared monthly with partners via email. 
Pacers Bikeshare aggregate data is released to the public periodically via a press release. 
Crash data is available using the online Aries portal and the public must request a login. A 
data-sharing agreement with Uber and BlueIndy allows the city access to their collected data.
Data collection and sharing across departments and partners could provide a detailed 
picture of how the city is performing and lead to better decision-making. A central 
information portal providing access to the public and partners will require a data collection 
and management architecture. The City will lead this initiative bringing together partners and 
corporations to establish sharing policies and operating procedures. . A corporate 
partnership with the Smart City Alliance (AT&T Mobility LLC, Ericsson, Inc., and IBM) would 
allow for providing of information on the tools and cloud-based technology necessary for 
transportation data collection, monitoring, and integration.INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 27In partnership with IUPUI, a user portal will be established. IUPUI’s COMET Lab – an applied 
interactive media development laboratory in the School of Informatics and Computing – will 
develop novel, citizen-centered designs for interactive “omnichannel” access, navigation, 
search and browsing of interactive, real-time Smart Corridor data. Nimble, context-, 
location-aware and customizable data-driven interactive applications will be available to 
citizens on a variety of personal user interface channels (including: web, mobile, smart 
watches) that will enable various user profiles to access, search, explore, gain 
recommendations and insights from large-scale, real-time traffic data and public information.
10.0 Research and Documentation on ITS and Connected Vehicles
A Regional ITS Architecture, developed by the Indy MPO is already in place, providing the 
foundation for transportation system integration. IUPUI and the City plans to partner with 
architecture and standards developers to improve connected vehicle and ITS solutions. 
These Smart Corridors offer testing opportunities for the technologies of automation or 
connected vehicles, ITS, and the implementation of real-time data analytics for 
transportation system management. Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) technology deployment 
will be evaluated throughout the process; system utilization, congestion, air quality, and 
safety performance measures will be adopted and monitored throughout deployment. 
Capital and on-going operating costs will be summarized in a Cost-Benefit Analysis repor t 
based on selected performance measures.
11.0 Goals and Objectives
The goals for transportation in Indianapolis have been set both from a regional mobility 
standpoint through the Marion County Thoroughfare Plan  and from a community-inspired, 
collaborative-based planning effort known as Plan 2020. 
 “Four defining qualities describe not what the Indianapolis community is, but what it 
 wants to become , which is to make Indianapolis a healthier, more resilient, more 
 inclusive, more competitive city  (Plan2020).”
The Smart Corridor project will make roadways safer and more accessible for all by using 
data to make more informed decision about infrastructure investments and management. 
Monitoring the demonstration project’s effect on safety, mobility, efficiency, sustainability, 
and climate change will require hardware installation, emissions monitoring equipment, and 
the selection of robust performance measures. With our university and research partners, 
ESN, and public transit operators, the City will set up a system, operating procedure, and 
work flow capable of collecting and monitoring the Smart Corridors’ performance through 
deployment and into the future.INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 28An Inclusive,

 INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 2912.0 Capacity to Execute Smart Corridors
Leadership & Collaboration
Indy’s commitment to the vision of Smart Corridors will be executed by the partners who 
developed this vision collaboratively and are committed to this great city: The City of 
Indianapolis, IUPUI, ESN, Indianapolis MPO, the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce, and 
IndyGo. The City of Indianapolis will provide full-time staff dedicated to overseeing the 
project’s planning, deployment, and monitoring. As our major research partner, IUPUI has 
identified project leads for the development of technology systems and evaluations of the 
Smart Corridor technology and data analysis. The City’s Smart Corridor project embodies our 
goal of fostering business innovation, employing advanced energy technologies, and building 
sustainable transportation. Its success will rely on traditional investments and commitments 
and the ability to adapt to the unforeseen hurdles that come with breaking new ground.
RebuildIndy is a testament to Indy’s ability to 
manage a project of a similar scale to the 
proposed Smart Corridor project. RebuildIndy 
was an initiative under former Mayor Gregory 
Ballard to restore deteriorating streets, 
sidewalks and bridges, greenspaces as well as
 address neighborhood drainage and flooding 
issues. Delivery of infrastructure projects cut 
through much of the existing red tape; design
 time was reduced by 3-4 months while 
streamlining saved projects up to 20 percent. 
This investment continues to transform neighborhoods throughout Indianapolis. 
Infrastructure Readiness
Indianapolis is unique as the only city in the United States which stands ready to automate 
transportation systems in a clean and sustainable way leveraging the publicly accessible 
electrification transportation systems that are already in existence or currently in 
development including BlueIndy and the eBRT Red Line. Combined, these systems are the 
result of more than $50 million invested to date and another nearly $100 million planned 
for the Red Line.  This offers a generational opportunity to accelerate the integration of the 
nation’s largest and most advanced electric car sharing and eBRT systems with cutting edge 
automation and connected vehicle technologies in an environment that will reach tens of 
thousands of consumers. Indianapolis provides an ideal and pragmatic location for 
autonomous vehicle technology development. Over the last few years, Indianapolis has very 
quietly become the most connected, electrified city in the U.S. through several key large-scale 
projects including the largest all electric car-share fleet in the U.S. The opportunity for testing 
and validation of automated transportation technologies is ripe. IndyGo’s vehicle and bus 
fleet are being converted to an all-electric fleet as well as the City’s vehicles.
Despite state-of-the-art technology and system monitoring on the highways, Indianapolis 
ITS deployment is slowly upgrading from legacy systems installed in the 1980s and 1990s. 
While there would be multiple systems to integrate and connect, the City is ready to install 
and upgrade their existing system. Indianapolis is uniquely positioned to upgrade its ITS 
system due to the national expertise found locally through the INDOT team.
INDIANAPOLIS SMART CORRIDORS        PAGE 30INDOT provides national leadership for TMC models and ITS deployment; INDOT TMC staff 
travel the nation advising communities on their systems, helping plan for and select new 
technology, and anticipate and address potential problems. INDOT’s partnership will be key 
to the implementation of a local and connected ITS system. Their national expertise will be 
especially important while selecting ITS technologies and building the best base model for 
timing plans from base traffic patterns.
13.0 Leveraging Federal Resources
Indianapolis knows how to make targeted investments that improve livability, creating 
opportunities for its residence and drive economic growth while getting the most from each 
dollar. Indianapolis has been able to maximize competitively awarded federal transportation 
dollars on an impressive scale.  The Cultural Trail was funded through a large public-private 
partnership (PPP) led by Central Indiana Community Foundation, the City of Indianapolis, and 
multiple not-for-profit partners. Research evaluating the economic and community impact 
found assessed property value within one block of the eight-mile trail increased 148 percent 
for a total increase of $1 billion16.  We will apply this tenacity to developing our PPP for the 
Smart Corridor project. 
As a part of a unique Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) rate case settlement for 
the BlueIndy project, Indianapolis Power and Light (IPL/AES) is currently required to conduct 
a full study of V2G technology and methodologies utilizing the BlueIndy platform that will 
match this project.
Using the Smart Cities grant, Indianapolis proposes to develop a production-ready 
application of BRT docking guidance technology to implement along with the Red Line BRT 
project.  By packaging both the docking precision and electric propulsion into a single 
project, we believe that the Red Line can be a model for low-cost rapid transit around the 
world.
The Airport Shuttle Automation project could be replicated to other U.S. airports as well as 
any company with a campus-to-campus employee shuttle (e.g., Lilly Corporation, Cummins 
Engine, other Indiana-based corporate companies) or companies who move goods regularly 
between fixed route nodes.

1Introduction 
William T. Coleman, Jr., the fourth Secretary of 
TransportaƟ  on, painted a picture of the ways 
in which our society would travel and interact. Under his leadership, the U.S. Department of TransportaƟ  on set about creaƟ  ng a planning 
and decision-making framework to guide that future.  Secretary Coleman’s future became reality…for most of the country.  For others, Ɵ me seemed to stand sƟ  ll and liƩ  le progress 
was made. Such is the case for the City of Birmingham.
Fast forward to today.  Under the leadership 
of Secretary of TransportaƟ  on Anthony Foxx, 
the U.S. Department of TransportaƟ  on has 
developed a 30-year transportaƟ  on plan for 
the naƟ  on.  The plan, enƟ  tled Beyond Traﬃ   c, 
has a very clear thesis: the United States needs to pivot away from its reliance on the car towards mobility systems that are beƩ  er 
suited to ciƟ  es.  We couldn’t agree more!
The City of Birmingham will be one of the 
U.S. ciƟ  es that helps the naƟ  on achieve its 
transportaƟ  on vision.  The City is reemerging 
as a vibrant southern city, a place where people choose to live, businesses can innovate, grow, and thrive, and visitors seek out for historic, cultural, and recreaƟ  onal 
experiences. Through careful comprehensive community planning, good leadership, collaboraƟ  on and targeted investment, 
Birmingham is taking advantage of new opportuniƟ  es, and improving the overall 
quality of life for its residents.  Renewed investment in the City’s transportaƟ  on system 
will breathe new life into the City, especially those areas that are experiencing urban decay.Our City 
Located in a dramaƟ  c physical landscape, 
Birmingham is the county seat of Jeﬀ  erson 
County and is the largest city in Alabama.  It is ﬂ  anked by parallel mountain ridges of 
the southern extension of the Appalachian Mountains, which contain the minerals upon which the city’s early heavy industry was founded. MulƟ  ple railroad corridors that 
thread their way through the Birmingham area were the key to the city’s development as an industrial powerhouse, facilitaƟ  ng the 
transformaƟ  on of the area’s rich mineral 
wealth into one of the naƟ  on’s most important 
sources of iron and steel during the Industrial RevoluƟ  on. 
Economic decline iniƟ  ated by populaƟ  on 
ﬂ ight to the suburbs was exacerbated by the 
concurrent mass exodus of heavy industrial jobs from Birmingham. The iron and steel industry had long been the foundaƟ  on of 
middle income prosperity in Birmingham. However, by the 21st century, this keystone had been eﬀ  ecƟ vely pulled from Birmingham’s 
economic arch. 
As the eﬀ  ects of the Great Recession of 
2008 are waning, Birmingham is gaining vitality and populaƟ  on. This is in part thanks 
to a mammoth eﬀ  ort to reinvent itself as a 
more livable community, aƩ  racƟ  ve for the 
businesses and professionals that will drive our economy in the 21st century. The Smart City concepts presented herein will support this renewal and help expand economic opportunity to Birmingham’s long neglected  minority and low-income neighborhoods.
According to the 2010 U.S. Census’s 
Designated Place data, the City of Birmingham had a populaƟ  on of 212,237.  At that Ɵ  me, 
the City comprised 28.3% of the urbanized area’s total populaƟ  on, and had an average 
populaƟ  on density of 1,453 persons per Meeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
2square mile.  This is well within the populaƟ  on 
and density characterisƟ  cs of a Smart City.
According the U.S. Bureau of the Census’s 
LEHD, the City of Birmingham contains approximately 163,000 jobs, of which just under 130,000 are located in the awarded Birmingham BRT corridor. The Downtown and UAB/Five Points South subareas combined have over 70,000 jobs, which is approximately 43 percent of the City’s total jobs, and 54 percent of the jobs in the BRT corridor.  The BRT corridor plays an important role in our vision to transform Birmingham into a Smart City. The vision will be arƟ  culated more clearly 
later in this response.
Other things to know about the City of 
Birmingham include:
• Birmingham has 99 neighborhoods
• Birmingham is the Southeast’s premier 
medical mecca
• 18,,500 students are enrolled in UAB
• Close to 80 percent of the State of Alabama’s populaƟ  on is within a 100 mile 
radius of the City of Birmingham
• Birmingham is served by ﬁ  ve (5) interstate 
highways: I-20, I-59, I-65, I-22, and I-459
• Birmingham is served by three (3) Tier 1 rail providers
• 60 percent of the 11 state Southeastern market can be reached by truck within one-day’s freight travel Ɵ  me
• 90 percent of the U.S. populaƟ  on can be 
reached by truck within a three-day freight travel Ɵ  me
In terms of how the City of Birmingham relates 
to the State of Alabama and the synergisƟ  c 
role of the two enƟ  Ɵ es, know that  Alabama 
is now the ﬁ  Ō h largest auto producing state, 
and employment in the sector is approaching 40,000. Alabama’s three global automakers, Mercedes-Benz, Honda and Hyundai, combined to produce more than 1 million 
vehicles in 2015, the ﬁ  rst Ɵ  me the state’s 
annual output has reached that big-league milestone.  All three automakers are exploring, and have incorporated autonomous vehicle technology into their vehicles.  This technology includes everything from navigaƟ  on systems, 
to communicaƟ  ons and entertainment 
systems, to automaƟ  c braking, and crash 
avoidance systems.
Automobile and parts manufacturing, and the 
technology that accompanies it has become the state ’s top e xport category , reaching $6.6 
billion in 2014. New auto-related investment in the sector during the past four-years tops $5.5 billion. 
Birmingham city closely aligns with the 
USDOT’s characterisƟ  cs for a Smart City, as it 
provides:
• ExisƟ  ng public transportaƟ  on system 
and plans for new addiƟ  ons to the public 
transportaƟ  on services; 
• Environment that is conducive to 
demonstraƟ  ng proposed strategies;
• Leadership with proven record of 
commitment and dedicaƟ  on, and the 
capacity to carry out the demonstraƟ  on 
throughout the period of performance;
• A solid commitment to integraƟ  ng with 
the sharing economy and share assets in a seamless way; and
• A clear commitment to open data and data sharing, thus making data accessible and usable by the public to maximize beneﬁ  t 
and promote entrepreneurship and innovaƟ  on.Become America’s Next Smart City
3Our Challenge
The City of Birmingham is challenged to 
meet its mobility needs because of its poor transportaƟ  on connecƟ  vity across all modes, 
underuƟ  lizaƟ  on of exisƟ  ng transportaƟ  on 
resources, limited transit, bicycle, and pedestrian opƟ  ons, and aging/crumbling 
and outdated transportaƟ  on infrastructure.  
The transportaƟ  on system has been cited 
as a barrier to opportuniƟ  es and access to 
both health services and healthy foods.  The historic network of roadways is not friendly to pedestrians or cyclists, and the general lack of pedestrian faciliƟ  es and inter-community 
connecƟ  ons are all contributors to a widening 
gap in socio-economic condiƟ  ons.  In addiƟ  on, 
the City of Birmingham also is confronted with a declining total populaƟ  on, an aging ciƟ  zen 
base, and concentraƟ  ons of poverty. Each of 
these issues is exacerbated by the poor quality of the exisƟ  ng transportaƟ  on system.
AddiƟ  onally, the City does not have 
informaƟ  on systems built. The technology and 
data that currently exists are disconnected and isolated, and endures in pockets/silos. The challenge is to integrate it all -- the systems, the technology, the informaƟ  on – and to exploit its 
power to the fullest.

The City is transforming rapidly and its change is inevitable.  Birmingham’s downtown is already experiencing a resurgence, and the City as a whole is undergoing a regeneraƟ  on of 
its ninety-nine (99) neighborhoods. The City’s revitalizaƟ  on eﬀ  orts are largely focused on: 
improving quality of life for ciƟ  zens; protecƟ  ng 
and enhancing the unique sense of place; rebuilding the economy with a foundaƟ  on 
of diversity and resiliency; and orientaƟ  on 
toward innovaƟ  on and a healthy workforce. 
Birmingham and its greater region are strategically targeƟ  ng catalyƟ  c transportaƟ  on 
and land use/land development eﬀ  orts in a 
handful of core areas and travel corridors, and are beginning to realize success through these areas successful transformaƟ  on.  For this 
success to conƟ  nue, the City of Birmingham 
needs to make a “big leap”, and modernize its transportaƟ  on infrastructure and service 
delivery. However, modernizaƟ  on does not 
mean looking to the status quo. Instead, the City of Birmingham is looking to become a naƟ onal leader for urban mobility.
In 2015, the U.S. Department of TransportaƟ  on 
awarded the City of Birmingham a TIGER VII grant to build a bus rapid transit (BRT) system in three (3) disƟ  ncƟ ve travel corridors and 
the Birmingham City Center.  The provision of Federal funding to assist with the development of this important infrastructure component is a criƟ  cal catalyƟ  c element for the project.  The 
BRT itself is one of the larger catalyƟ  c elements 
intended to support, and in some cases help jump start, the redevelopment of impoverished neighborhoods.  The hope and promise of the BRT system is that it will usher in a new era of travel for the City of Birmingham; that it will strengthen the City’s diverse communiƟ  es 
by connecƟ  ng them to services and linking 
residents to opportuniƟ  es. However, the City’s 
transportaƟ  on transformaƟ  on does not end 
here as this is just the beginning.
Our Vision
Our vision is to uƟ  lize new transportaƟ  on 
and infrastructure technologies, Smart City elements, and innovaƟ  ve urban 
transportaƟ  on approaches to transform 
the City of Birmingham into a modern, thriving community that showcases the transformaƟ  onal power of the Smart City 
concept on mobility, accessibility, economic growth, land development, equity, and quality of lifeMeeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
4The City of Birmingham is looking to remake 
itself into a 21st Century City.  Its leadership has a renewed commitment to the City’s growth and development, and is acƟ  vely 
seeking new ways to aƩ  ract new talent and 
business.  They know that in order to achieve the vision that they have set for Birmingham’s future and overcome its past deﬁ  cits, that they 
need to take bold acƟ  ons to remediate the 
City’s transportaƟ  on system.
The City of Birmingham has a strong desire for 
its transportaƟ  on system to establish a broad 
reach, linking the City and the region that it serves to new markets and desƟ  naƟ ons around 
the world. At the same Ɵ  me Birmingham’s 
leadership is seeking to take advantage of both the City’s geographic locaƟ  on and 
historic legacy as the “PiƩ  sburgh of the 
South”, building upon the exisƟ  ng inter-modal 
freight rail network, and capitalizing on its new interstate connecƟ  ons --gaining from the 
combined strengths of individual modes.
Birmingham’s vision for its transformaƟ  on 
reﬂ ect a city that is intelligent in character--
harnessing the tremendous power of digital social networks, elements of the sharing economy, and technological advancements to expand its economic and social capabiliƟ  es, 
and exploit its tremendous potenƟ  al.  It 
is inclusive in its services-- always moving forward, leaving no one behind. The transportaƟ  on system is innovaƟ  ve in its scope. 
It derives its beneﬁ  t from integrated data, 
technology and smarter use of its exisƟ  ng 
infrastructure.
The City of Birmingham’s vision is closely 
linked with the ideas expressed in both its comprehensive plan. The Comprehensive Plan holisƟ  cally addresses the development of its 
communiƟ  es, looking at economic condiƟ  ons, 
land development paƩ  erns and trends, 
transportaƟ  on needs, human health dispariƟ  es, 
and the overall quality of life. FacilitaƟ  ng community reinvestment, especially in the low-
income and minority neighborhoods, is one of the primary goals of Birmingham’s response to the Smart CiƟ  es Challenge. Through its 
inclusive planning process and strategic public investment, the City of Birmingham has set in moƟ  on an economic engine that is gaining 
the momentum needed to restore prosperity to Birmingham’s neighborhoods. The new construcƟ  on occurring in the Parkside District 
and Woodlawn are evidence that with targeted public investment community renewal is possible.
The City’s approach to catalyzing a renaissance 
of its neighborhoods is to center revitalizaƟ  on 
eﬀ orts around “strategic opportunity areas.” 
The strategic opportunity areas are acƟ  vity 
centers that contain the necessary economic, social, and transportaƟ  on resources to help 
them be successful.  The comprehensive plan calls for linking a number of strategic opportunity areas together along the BRT corridor like a string of pearls, and locaƟ  ng BRT 
staƟ ons within them.  This acknowledges the 
transformaƟ  ve power of transportaƟ  on, and is 
key to the City’s revitalizaƟ  on strategy. In short, 
the strategic opportunity areas are intended to serve mulƟ  ple funcƟ  ons, and are envisioned to 
be the catalysts for community reinvestment.  One of the funcƟ  ons intended for the strategic 
opportunity areas is for them to serve as “mobility hubs”. 
Mobility Hubs are an aƩ  empt to address the 
negaƟ  ves brought about by land development 
paƩ erns that responds exclusively to a single 
travel mode, the automobile, and whose supporƟ  ve infrastructure (i.e. wide, high-
speed arterial roadways, parking faciliƟ  es, 
etc.), discourages the movement and use of other transportaƟ  on modes.  They are places 
of connecƟ  vity where diﬀ  erent modes of 
transportaƟ  on – from walking to biking to 
transit to shared ride services – come together seamlessly. They also support intensive Become America’s Next Smart City
5concentraƟ  ons of higher density development, 
accommodaƟ  ng places for people of all 
incomes, age, and ability to work, live, shop and/or play, and connecƟ  ng communiƟ  es to 
the rest of the region through reliable, rapid transit services. In essence, mobility hubs are acƟ vity centers that integrate land use and 
transportaƟ  on, and epitomize the City’s vision 
for its future.
Mobility hubs are hardly a household phrase. 
But the concept of a central places that links diﬀ erent modes of transportaƟ  on, as well as 
other things such as shopping, entertainment, recreaƟ  on and family services – is fundamental 
to the City of Birmingham’s vision for its revitalized communiƟ  es. They elevate the 
importance of public transit, cycling, and pedestrian travel. This elevaƟ  on of importance 
is criƟ  cal to ensuring the development of 
an eﬃ   cient, sustainable transportaƟ  on 
system. Public transit and non-motorized transportaƟ  on faciliƟ  es within the hubs help 
to reduce automobile travel, which impacts air quality. Equalizing and/or prioriƟ  zing cycling 
and pedestrian travel within mobility hubs also helps in addressing community health issues by providing employees, residents, and visitors to communiƟ  es that host mobility hubs the 
opportunity for walking and cycling. 
Mobility hubs are proposed t o be lo cated 
within neighborhood acƟ  vity centers, and are 
all about making it easier to move from one mode of transportaƟ  on to another, anchoring 
seamless, convenient connecƟ  ons across 
the metropolitan planning area. They’re also about improving the relaƟ  onship between 
transportaƟ  on and land use. There’s no point 
building a mobility hub in the proverbial “middle of nowhere.” In order for them to work, mobility hubs need t o be lo cated close 
to many people, whether they are at work, at home, or at play. In other words, they need to be livable.ComplemenƟ  ng the Birmingham BRT’s service 
design and capital investment, which will reduce the need for customers to travel to Birmingham’s downtown to transfer, mobility hubs will help customers access the BRT and other local transportaƟ  on opƟ  ons, as well as 
provide a viable, cost-eﬀ  ecƟ ve soluƟ  on for “last 
mile” connecƟ  ons.
Table 1 provides a descripƟ  on of how the 
mobility hubs are envisioned to work within the City of Birmingham.
IncorporaƟ  on of new technologies into the 
infrastructure, tesƟ  ng of automated and 
connected vehicle technologies, use of smart data collecƟ  on and sharing pracƟ  ces, smart 
land use, and user-focused mobility services are all of criƟ  cal importance to the successful 
implementaƟ  on of the Mobility Hubs concept.
Our vision is for the City of Birmingham to 
be a living laboratory for tesƟ  ng innovaƟ  ve 
transportaƟ  on concepts that will allow the City 
of Birmingham to close exisƟ  ng socioeconomic 
gaps that have been deﬁ  ning transportaƟ  on 
mobility, access to services, and growth opportuniƟ  es for years and provide enhanced 
transportaƟ  on opƟ  ons to move people 
and goods in a safer, more eﬃ   cient, more 
sustainable, and more equitable way. 
If selected for the Smart City Challenge, the 
City of Birmingham proposes to leverage exisƟ  ng resources, expand on recent 
transportaƟ
 on and urban planning iniƟ  aƟ ves, 
and introduce new technologies, strategies, and insƟ  tuƟ onal changes to address local 
transportaƟ  on challenges, spur economic 
development, and improve the quality of life for our ciƟ  zens. 
TransportaƟ  on opƟ  ons that are currently 
available or planned, and that will support the Mobility Hub concept include:Meeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
6• Traﬃ  c Management Center (TMC) . The 
City of Birmingham operates a Traﬃ   c 
Management Cent er (TMC), lo cated 
in Birmingham’s City Hall. The TMC is designed to monitor traﬃ   c using 
CCTV cameras and control traﬃ   c signal 
intersecƟ  ons, and proacƟ  vely deploy 
traﬃ  c management strategies to reduce 
congesƟ  on during special events, 
emergencies, or daily stop-and-go traﬃ   c.  
• Public TransportaƟ  on. In 2015, the City of 
Birmingham applied for and subsequently won a U.S. Department of TransportaƟ  on 
TIGER VII grant to assist the City with the development of its long planned bus rapid transit (BRT) system. The BRT system will be the spine of a re-imagined transit system, where the BRT serves a series of mobility hubs, and local bus services feed the BRT system instead of running into a central locaƟ  on. The BRT is proposed to a 
10-minute frequency during the peak travel periods, and a 15-minute headway during the oﬀ  -peak periods.
• Local Bus Service improvements .  The 
Birmingham Jeﬀ  erson County Transit 
Authority also is undertaking a complete overhaul of its ﬁ  xed-route bus services. 
While the major improvements to local bus services are primarily focused on changes to routes, improvements also include technology upgrades such as automated vehicle locaƟ  on (AVL), real-Ɵ  me vehicle 
arrival systems, automated passenger counters (APC), and electronic payment systems.
• Car Sharing Program . The City of 
Birmingham hosts a car share program.  The University of Birmingham at Alabama (UAB) Car Share, is operated by a private enƟ ty and is currently limited to students 
and faculty at UAB.  Employed as part of the University’s congesƟ  on management 
strategy, the car share program provides these individuals who need a car for occasional use an opƟ  on to rent a vehicle 
for a short period of Ɵ  me.
• CommuteSmart . The City of Birmingham is 
an acƟ  ve partner in the Regional Planning 
Commission of Greater Birmingham’s CommuteSmart iniƟ  aƟ ve. CommuteSmart 
is a commuter services program that operates in the State of Alabama’s four (4) metropolitan transportaƟ  on management 
Table 1. Mobiliity Hub Typologies
Regional Mobility Hubs Serving mulƟ  ple communiƟ  es, regional mobility hubs serve regional 
acƟ vity centers and have the potenƟ  al for the highest levels of populaƟ  on 
and employment densiƟ  es, and that generate the highest levels of travel 
demand to and from these centers. PotenƟ  al transit travel modes include 
high-capacity public transportaƟ  on services such as Birmingham’s planned 
bus rapid transit (BRT) system, as well as express and local bu s services.

to maintain 35 vanpools.  They idenƟ  fy 
2,559 acƟ  ve carpools in the rideshare 
database.
• Commercial Shared Ride Services . The 
City of Birmingham recently passed an ordinance allowing shared ride services such as Uber and LyŌ   to operate within 
the City of Birmingham. Many of the City’s neighboring jurisdicƟ  ons followed suit soon 
aŌ er, noƟ  ng that it did not make sense 
for them to do so if Birmingham did not allow these services as Birmingham is the economic, cultural, and entertainment hub for the region.
• Inter-modal ConnecƟ  ons . The City of 
Birmingham is currently compleƟ  ng 
construcƟ  on on an inter-modal 
transportaƟ  on center in its downtown. 
The Birmingham Inter-modal Center will provide connecƟ  ons between local bus 
services, interregional and intercity bus services, passenger rail, taxi and shared ride services, bikeshare, and the City’s urban trail network.  
• Bikes Share StaƟ  ons/Bicycle FaciliƟ  es. 
Since 2015, the City of Birmingham is home to the Zyp Bikeshare program. Currently, Zyp Bikeshare is a dense network of kiosks and bikes whose exisƟ  ng services are 
primarily focused in Birmingham’s City Center and its adjacent neighborhoods.  Zyp has aspiraƟ  ons of expanding beyond 
downtown, and is looking to provide bikeshare across the City, as well as in neighboring ciƟ  es. The Zyp bikes are 
“smart bikes.” That is, the bicycles employ technology that knows where they are, and where they’ve been. Travelers can check their previous routes on the web or within Zyp Bikeshare’s app, a useful tool for individuals seeking to achieve a health goal, 
planning enƟ  Ɵ es looking to idenƟ  fy travel 
paƩ erns, or for folks who simply want to 
know where they have been. 
Along with state of the art bicycles, Zyp 
Bikeshare also employs sustainable docking staƟ ons. The staƟ  ons use clean energy, 
and are powered independently. Both the staƟ on and bikes are charged fully by solar 
panels. StaƟ  ons and bikes c ommuni cate 
with the larger network wirelessly. StaƟ  ons 
may be permanent. However, their design allows them to be portable so that they can be adapted temporarily for speciﬁ  c events.
The City of Birmingham envisions that 
Zyp Bikeshare staƟ  ons will be lo cated in 
all mobility hubs, and provide seamless connecƟ  ons for travelers who choose to 
use transit, walk, or drive to the acƟ  vity 
centers and the adjacent neighborhoods. 
• Car Share Access . Car sharing oﬀ  ers a 
potenƟ  al model for the City of Birmingham 
in its quest to become a Smart City.  While car sharing is not currently accessible beyond the UAB campus, car sharing can support Birmingham’s eﬀ  orts to revitalize 
communiƟ  es and make them more livable 
by reducing the need for addiƟ  onal/
larger roadway infrastructure and surface parking. AddiƟ  onally, car sharing can 
provide a potenƟ  al economic savings for 
both government and private companies 
Meeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
8by helping to reduce their ﬂ  eet costs, 
minimize local transportaƟ  on expenses, 
and meet sustainability goals.
• Pedestrian FaciliƟ  es. In 2010, the 
Freshwater Land Trust, in partnership with the Jeﬀ  erson County Department of Health, 
completed the Red Rock Ridge and Valley Trail Plan (Red Rock) for Jeﬀ  erson County, 
home-county to the City of Birmingham.  The City of Birmingham subsequently adopted the Red Rock Plan and has since integrated it into it comprehensive plan and supporƟ  ng Community Framework Plans.  
In 2011, the City of Birmingham applied for and was awarded a TIGER IV grant. EnƟ  tled 
Roads to Recovery, the TIGER IV grant is the ﬁ rst phase of a planned Complete Streets 
and mulƟ  -modal transportaƟ  on system, 
and helped the City to jumpstart the implementaƟ  on of the Red Rock mulƟ  -use 
trail system.  To date, more than 27 miles of sidewalks, bike lanes, and oﬀ  -road trails 
have been constructed.
• Smart Parking . With roughly 4,700 
on-street parking meters and another 7,000 structured parking spaces, there is tremendous opportunity for the City of Birmingham to uƟ  lize interacƟ  ve parking 
systems that would help alleviate traﬃ   c 
congesƟ  on, provide CiƟ  zen and visitor 
convenience and increase City revenue.The City has reviewed several Smart 
Parking System soluƟ  ons and is preparing 
to procure a system that meets its desired needs, such as the ability to idenƟ  fy 
available open on-street parking spots and open spaces in parking garages on an interacƟ  ve map.  The desired system will 
also enable user to pay for parking using a smart phone app that is compaƟ  ble with 
IOS, Android and Windows. Users also would be noƟ  ﬁ ed when their meter Ɵ  me is 
about to expire.
Become America’s Next Smart City
9In addiƟ  on to these Smart CiƟ  es strategies, the 
City of Birmingham also is acƟ  vely working to 
embrace freight transportaƟ  on as part of its 
vision for the Smart CiƟ  es Challenge.  Building 
on the region’s success in obtaining a TIGER I grant for the Birmingham Regional Inter-modal Freight facility, the City of Birmingham is looking to develop freight villages, integrated logisƟ  cs centers to take advantage 
of its exisƟ  ng rail, highway, and waterway 
infrastructure.
A freight village is a deﬁ  ned area within 
which all acƟ  viƟ es relaƟ  ng to transportaƟ  on, 
logisƟ  cs and the distribuƟ  on of goods, both for 
naƟ onal and internaƟ  onal transit, are carried 
out by various operators.  Freight villages, as envisioned for Birmingham, will accommodate state-of-the-art distribuƟ  on centers and 
industrial acƟ  viƟ es that serve large market 
areas, and shun passive acƟ  viƟ es such as 
container storage. These types of distribuƟ  on 
centers and automated manufacturing and industrial acƟ  viƟ es are already beginning 
to occur within the Greater Birmingham region around the automoƟ  ve manufacturing 
industry.
The City of Birmingham’s goal in developing 
freight villages is to leverage freight operaƟ  ons 
to create economic value for underuƟ  lized 
and abandoned industrial sites, and in parƟ  cular provide 
a strategy for the reuse of brownﬁ  eld sites.  The City also 
is looking to create shared value for the communiƟ  es in 
which the freight village would be located.  This includes the development and expansion of support businesses such as retail (restaurants, banking, stores), and hotels, as well as providing oﬃ   ce space for 
non-retail businesses. Other City goals to be accomplished through the development of freight villages 
include: a. increased rail mode share, b. improved environmental quality, and c. the creaƟ  on of a more eﬃ   cient and cost-eﬀ  ecƟ ve 
freight delivery system.
The City of Birmingham’s freight villages 
are envisioned to be lo cated adjacent to 
modal shiŌ   faciliƟ  es. Modal shiŌ   faciliƟ  es are 
themselves located within the freight village.  Modal shiŌ   faciliƟ  es are transportaƟ  on faciliƟ  es 
where goods are moved between two or more forms of freight transportaƟ  on such as rail to 
truck; barge to rail/truck; air and rail/truck.  They will be sensiƟ  ve to the surrounding land 
uses, blending in with their communiƟ  es, and 
contribuƟ  ng to the City’s quality of life.  Ideally, 
they will employ the City’s newly developed character based zoning criteria, showcasing how open space and industrial space can coexist, demonstraƟ  ng the City’s desire to 
Incorporate “green building” techniques and employ low impact design for parking and staging areas. 
There are several exisƟ  ng industrial sites within 
the City of Birmingham with rail access that are proximate to interstate highways, and have both air and water transport nearby.  These are locaƟ  ons where freight villages might evolve 
and thrive.

of the Smart City Challenge and summarize lessons learned for the beneﬁ  t of other ciƟ  es 
facing similar challenges. Also, remaining technical, insƟ  tuƟ onal, and policy challenges 
related to deployment of systems that support Smart City prioriƟ  es will be idenƟ  ﬁ ed and 
countermeasures to address them will be presented.
Our Approach
Building on our current assets and strategic plans for moving Birmingham forward, we intend to use the Smart City Challenge funding to introduce smart, technology-driven transportaƟ  on improvements that will address 
current transportaƟ  on challenges idenƟ  ﬁ ed 
within a city and provide equitable, high quality transportaƟ  on opƟ  ons and services 
to fulﬁ  ll the needs of the traveling public and 
transportaƟ  on industries.
The City’s vision for its transformaƟ  on into a 
Smart City is inclusive of many of the elements of the USDOT’s deﬁ  niƟ on of a smart city.  As 
such, several Smart City transportaƟ  on systems 
improvements and innovaƟ  ons which are 
envisioned to be employed in Birmingham are closely linked with USDOT’s vision elements of a successful Smart City. Examples include the following: 
• Connected Vehicles . The City of 
Birmingham plans to uƟ  lize funds from 
the Smart City Challenge to instrument its infrastructure to meet the transportaƟ  on 
mobility needs of the future.  Two-way short-to- medium-range wireless communicaƟ  ons capability is an important 
ﬁ rst step in this direcƟ  on. The City will use 
Dedicat ed Short Range Communi caƟ ons 
(DSRC) technology to enable informaƟ  on 
sharing among instrumented vehicles (V2V) and between instrumented vehicles 
and infrastructure (V2I) which is crucial for allowing tesƟ  ng and adopƟ  on of 
connected vehicles. Furthermore, the City will work with the Regional Planning Commission of Greater Birmingham -- the Birmingham region’s metropolitan planning organizaƟ  on and Central Alabama’s 
regional transportaƟ  on organizaƟ  on, the 
Alabama Department of TransportaƟ  on, 
and communicaƟ  ons providers to integrate 
various communicaƟ  ons plaƞ  orms that are 
enabled by either DSRC or other available networks in support of connected vehicles deployment.  This includes communicaƟ  ons 
technology such as cellular, Wi-Fi, or satellite.  Those communicaƟ  ons remove 
exisƟ  ng barriers through the promoƟ  on of 
shared transportaƟ  on processes, shared 
resources, and common rules of operaƟ  on.
Assuming the maturity of naƟ  onal research 
and development eﬀ  orts in the area of 
connected vehicles in the near future, the City of Birmingham will acƟ  vely seek 
opportuniƟ  es to parƟ  cipate in pilot tesƟ  ng 
Become America’s Next Smart City
13of connected vehicle concepts. As an early 
adopter of connected vehicles the City of Birmingham will validate its designaƟ  on 
as Smart City and will play an important role in connected vehicles evaluaƟ  on 
and technology transfer iniƟ  aƟ ves. The 
City also will work with BJCTA to explore opportuniƟ  es for instrumentaƟ  on of transit 
buses so that they can become part of the 
connected vehicles program.
Working closely with experts at the 
University of Alabama at Birmingham, the City will develop and implement a comprehensive plan for assessing impacts of connected vehicles deployment on congesƟ  on, traﬃ   c safety, fuel consumpƟ  on, 
air quality, and user saƟ  sfacƟ  on. 
Technology transfer, training, and outreach will provide evidence of the impacts of connected vehicles on mobility, safety, and the environment and will facilitate enhanced adopƟ  on and deployment of 
connected vehicles in other medium size ciƟ es in the future.
• Automated Transit Networks . The City of 
Birmingham understands the importance of urban automaƟ  on and plans to work 
closely with researcher partners at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the automoƟ  ve industry to remove 
insƟ tuƟ onal barriers and address new 
technical and policy challenges associated with vehicle automaƟ  on. The City of 
Birmingham is interested in pursuing the development and tesƟ  ng of an Automated 
Transit Network, more commonly known as Personal Rapid Transit (PRT).  PRT is probably best described as a hybrid between the private car and public transit. In concept, PRT vehicles could hold up to four people or fewer, mimicking the private, quiet ride of a car. RelaƟ  ve to 
exisƟ  ng transportaƟ  on alternaƟ  ves, 
there would be very liƩ  le emissions, no 
traﬃ  c congesƟ  on, no loud noises, and no oﬀ ensive odors produced by PRTs. PRT 
could eﬀ  ecƟ vely supplement Birmingham’s 
soon to be constructed bus rapid transit system, and encourage car-free development by providing desƟ  naƟ on-to-
desƟ naƟ on service with minimal walking to 
and from staƟ  ons. 
PRT is envisioned to be an important 
part of Birmingham’s ShuƩ  lesworth 
InternaƟ  onal Airport’s conƟ  nued evoluƟ  on, 
providing criƟ  cal connecƟ  ons between the 
airport terminal and its soon to be built consolidated rental car facility, proposed oﬃ  ce and light industrial development 
on adjacent properƟ  es, and hotel and 
conference space, and at the Uptown development lo cated a t the edge of 
downtown Birmingham.
• Intelligent, Sensor-Based Infrastructure . 
As a Smart City, the City of Birmingham realizes the importance of installing sensors on the transportaƟ  on network to 
monitor traﬃ   c condiƟ  ons, opƟ  mize signal 
Ɵ mings, support incident management, 
and facilitate informed decisions on mode choice, given real Ɵ  me informaƟ  on and 
available opƟ  ons. Birmingham is commiƩ  ed 
to addressing this need and plans to collaborate with the Alabama Department of TransportaƟ  on and experts at UAB to 
develop and implement sensor deployment

14plans that meet current and future 
needs of transportaƟ  on infrastructure 
instrumentaƟ  on.
A Smart City requires the use of technology 
to collect, process, and disseminate informaƟ  on thus allowing system managers 
and users to opƟ  mize eﬃ   ciency, safety, and 
conserve resources. The instrumentaƟ  on 
of vehicles, roadways, and other infrastructure with sensors, as well as the use of supporƟ  ng resources (such as video 
monitoring, tracking of GPS data from tags or mobile phone signals, smart fare cards) to monitor traﬃ   c condiƟ  ons and track 
the movement of vehicles, pedestrians and bicyclists in real Ɵ  me are all essenƟ  al 
ingredients for the delivery of a successful, integrated transportaƟ  on program that 
provides eﬃ   ciency 
and choice as part of a Smart City 
paradigm. 
DSRC wireless 
communicaƟ  ons, 
GPS, and vehicles sensors are needed to enable the exchange of informaƟ  on among 
connected vehicles and between instrumented vehicles and the infrastructure.  Smart phone apps allow users to get real Ɵ  me informaƟ  on about transit 
schedules, car-sharing opƟ  ons, bike-
sharing locaƟ  ons, and parking availability.  
AddiƟ  onally, smart sensors can be used 
to monitor conƟ  nuously the condiƟ  ons 
of transportaƟ  on network assets in order 
to opƟ  mize resources used for operaƟ  on 
and maintenance. Moreover, availability of robust data can help tremendously the City of Birmingham in its eﬀ  orts to prioriƟ  ze 
needs and make smart investment 
decisions in the future. 
Sensors may be also needed in buildings 
and other infrastructure elements to monitor their condiƟ  on, manage water use 
and wastewater, or for smart-grid energy transmission. For example, electrochemical sensors can be used to determine the vapors emanaƟ  ng from organic pollutants 
during rain events in storm drains and detect the chemical composiƟ  on of the 
contaminants. The chemical sensors can then be used to idenƟ  fy locaƟ  ons most 
sensiƟ  ve to polluƟ  on during rain events, 
which ulƟ  mately discharge untreated 
into receiving waters (such as rivers and streams). The City of Birmingham will work 
closely with local uƟ liƟ es companies to 
leverage resources from the Smart City Challenge program in order to introduce sensor instrumentaƟ  on 
on the Birmingham testbed. In addiƟ  on 
to using sensors as part of an intelligent infrastructure, Birmingham will explore the use of interacƟ  ve 
technologies, such as crowd-sourcing, to get informaƟ  on about 
ciƟ zens’ needs and preferences, which will 
help decision makers to address key issues aﬀ ecƟ ng the public as part of the Smart 
City program.
Some challenges sƟ  ll remain related to data 
fusion, integraƟ  on, and storage of the vast 
amounts of data expected to be generated within a Smart City context. The City of 
Become America’s Next Smart City
15Birmingham will rely on the experƟ  se of 
faculty at UAB to develop and employ appropriate data mining techniques that will assist greatly to interpret and use the data in eﬃ   cient and creaƟ  ve ways for the 
beneﬁ  t of the public.
• Urban AnalyƟ  cs. The mulƟ  -modal 
transportaƟ  on system envisioned for 
Birmingham will be driven by data. Data will allow system planning that truly reﬂ ects demand and community needs. 
The operaƟ  on and eﬀ  ecƟ veness of the 
transportaƟ  on system will be conƟ  nuously 
monitored in real-Ɵ  me, ensuring that 
community needs are being met regardless of condiƟ  ons. Data gathered from a variety 
of sources will allow the integraƟ  on of 
mobility with broader goals of community health and economic vitality. All of this will rely on the collecƟ  on of data from mulƟ  ple 
(and someƟ  mes seemingly disparate) 
sources, synthesis and analysis at a data center, and its provision to all stakeholders in a Ɵ  mely and easily accessible format. 
TransportaƟ  on data will be at the core, 
but data related to community health, economics, energy, and resiliency will be integrated as well to ensure that all members of the community are being served. 
TransportaƟ  on system monitoring has 
tradiƟ  onally been diﬃ   cult for medium sized 
ciƟ es like Birmingham. Unable to aﬀ  ord 
the extensive detector and monitoring systems found in many larger ciƟ  es, data 
collecƟ  on has oŌ  en depended on very 
limited sampling eﬀ  orts.  Fortunately, the 
foundaƟ  on for data analyƟ  cs is already 
in place in Birmingham. The Regional Planning Commission and UAB established the Regional TransportaƟ  on Data Center 
in 2009, a partnership which monitors the performance of the regional transportaƟ  on 
system and makes data and analysis available to stakeholders. Currently the Center focuses on collecƟ  ng and analyzing 
historical travel data such as counts, vehicle speeds, travel Ɵ  mes, transit usage, and 
incident reports. The data are used to monitor congesƟ  on trends, idenƟ  fy hot-
spots for congesƟ  on and incidents, and 
prioriƟ  ze transportaƟ  on projects. The data 
are also used to evaluate the eﬀ  ecƟ veness 
of transportaƟ  on improvement projects. 
But this is just scratching the surface of what the Center will be as the Birmingham vision moves forward. The Center has recently begun to incorporate more mulƟ  -modal data for transit, bicycles, and 
pedestrians. Freight will also have growing importance, as Birmingham serves as a link between the Piedmont-AtlanƟ  c and Gulf 
Coast mega-regions. 
To tackle the extensive analyƟ  cs that will 
be required in the future, UAB has brought their Big Data AnalyƟ  cs Lab into the eﬀ  ort. 
The lab, which originates in the Electrical Engineering Department, provides big data experƟ  se across the UAB medical and 
research centers and is pursuing cuƫ   ng-
edge research with industrial collaborators. By combining data from mulƟ  ple sources 
in novel ways, Birmingham will be able to develop a mulƟ  -modal transportaƟ  on 
system that truly supports the vision of personal mobility, community health, and economic vitality.
• Smart Cards . The City of Birmingham 
envisions that access to all of the transportaƟ  on services -- transit, bikeshare, 
parking -- will be seamless. Currently, 
Meeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
16the region’s transportaƟ  on providers all 
provide access to their services using diﬀ erent payment mediums. Public transit 
in Birmingham uƟ  lizes, cash, paper passes, 
and Ɵ  cket books.  Zyp Bikeshare users 
access bikes at kiosks using either a credit card or a pre-paid key fob.  They also can use their smart phones via the Zyp Bikeshare app.  Drivers accessing on-street parking and the City’s public structured parking faciliƟ  es use loose change and cash 
respecƟ  vely.
Smart cards, as envisioned for Birmingham, 
will employ new technology currently being deployed by the naƟ  on’s banks to provide 
travelers with a more secure payment system that is universally accepted, is ﬂ exible in its design, enables travelers 
to beƩ  er budget for transportaƟ  on, and 
allows access to travel across mulƟ  ple 
transportaƟ  on modes. Frequent use also 
will enable travelers to beƩ  er track their 
use of the transportaƟ  on system, as well 
as agencies to beƩ  er understand how 
the system is being used.  Finally, the technology will aid agencies to cut down on operaƟ  ng costs by eliminaƟ  ng the need 
to manage mulƟ  ple payment mediums 
and reducing the risk posed by fraud by physically collecƟ  ng money.
• Smart Land Use . The City of Birmingham 
has embraced its new urban future.  The Birmingham Comprehensive Plan (Comprehensive Plan), draŌ  ed in 2012 and 
adopted in October 2013, lays out a criƟ  cal 
foundaƟ  on for the achievement of a more 
vibrant and sustainable city and region. The Comprehensive Plan establishes an inclusive vision for revitalizaƟ  on. It 
oﬀ ers an exhausƟ  ve list of strategies for 
encouraging and aƩ  racƟ  ng community 
reinvestment, as well as ideas for how to develop healthy neighborhoods. This includes recommendaƟ  ons for a variety of housing choices accessible across a 
range of incomes, age, and ability as well as infrastructure recommendaƟ  ons for 
complete streets, and policies to minimize health dispariƟ  es.
Public and private investments in 
places and public ameniƟ  es such as the 
Woodlawn and Avondale neighborhoods, the Lakeview and Parkside districts, Railroad Park, Region’s Field, and the Birmingham Crossplex are all examples of the integrated, holisƟ  c approach 
that the City is taking to address the complex challenges it faces. The subsequent Framework Plans, district level comprehensive planning documents that build oﬀ   of the Comprehensive Plan, are 
the City’s primary policy tool for achieving its vision to be a City of Smart Places. The Framework Plans provide greater clarity, detail, and direcƟ  on for land use, land 
development, transportaƟ  on, housing, 
acƟ ve and passive greenspace i.e. parks, 
trails and open space, uƟ  liƟ es and 
economic development.
The concept of Smart Places revolves 
Become America’s Next Smart City
17around the City’s vision for its communiƟ  es 
and neighborhoods to be beƩ  er connected 
to services and opportuniƟ  es, to be 
more walkable and bicycle-friendly, to oﬀ er a range of housing choices that 
are aﬀ  ordable to all, to be supporƟ  ve of 
neighborhood scaled businesses as well as the larger urban economy, and to provide safe and healthy environments for its residents. To that end, City through its development of its mass transit services and parƟ  cularly the BRT system, will 
establish a system of connected mobility hubs. Mobility hubs were previously described in Our Vision for Birmingham as a Smart City.
• Strategic Business Models and Partnering OpportuniƟ  es. The City of Birmingham 
will collaborate very closely with the University of Alabama at Birmingham and uƟ  lize experƟ  se and technical 
capabiliƟ  es of faculty members at UAB 
to plan, design, implement, and evaluate iniƟ aƟ ves undertaken as part of the Smart 
City Challenge program. A collaboraƟ  on 
agreement between UAB and the City of Birmingham was signed in February 2013 and marked the beginning of this successful partnership which serves as a solid foundaƟ  on for the Smart City Challenge 
program. 
Through the UAB Sustainable Smart 
CiƟ es Research Center (SSCRC), UAB has 
an already established role as an engine of innovaƟ  on that can transform the 
community through the use of smart technologies and informaƟ  on systems, 
eﬀ ecƟ ve transportaƟ  on alternaƟ  ves, 
renewable energy opƟ  ons, and sustainable 
environment soluƟ  ons. The partnership 
between UAB Sustainable Smart CiƟ  es 
Research Center (UAB SSC) and the City of Birmingham creates excellent research, educaƟ  on, and training collaboraƟ  on 
opportuniƟ  es within a unique seƫ   ng where the city becomes a living laboratory 
for implementaƟ  on and tesƟ  ng of 
innovaƟ  ve research applicaƟ  on to beneﬁ  t 
the community.
Moreover, UAB is a University partner of 
the Southeast TransportaƟ  on Research, 
InnovaƟ  on and EducaƟ  on Center (STRIDE) 
a Regional University TransportaƟ  on 
Center (UTC) led by the University of Florida. STRIDE University partners devote their energies to three major focal areas: transportaƟ  on safety, livable communiƟ  es, 
and economic compeƟ  Ɵ veness which are 
directly related to Smart City Challenge program prioriƟ  es. UAB is also a member 
of the NaƟ  onal Center for TransportaƟ  on 
System ProducƟ  vity and Management 
(NCTSPM), a Tier 1 NaƟ  onal University 
TransportaƟ  on Center led by the Georgia 
InsƟ tute of Technology. 
 The well-established partnership 
between the City of Birmingham, UAB’s Sustainable Smart CiƟ  es Research Center, 
and the STRIDE and NCTSPM University TransportaƟ  on Centers as part of the Smart 
City Challenge will foster cross-disciplinary research, training, and outreach that will promote the development of innovaƟ  ve 
soluƟ  ons for sustainable smart ciƟ  es and 
communiƟ  es and disseminaƟ  on of ﬁ  ndings 
for the beneﬁ  t of transportaƟ  on agencies, 
professionals, and the public at large.
UAB’s commitment to economic 
development is also aligned with regional and state strategies, including “Blueprint Birmingham” — the community’s growth strategy led by Birmingham Business Alliance — and Accelerate Alabama, which seeks to drive recruitment of new projects, business retenƟ  on and develop home-
grown start-ups.
Figure 1 provides a graphic illustraƟ  on of the

18many of these Smart City concepts are desired.
It should be noted that this document only presents a high-level vision for the Birmingham’s proposed Smart City technology deployment. A detailed technical and management approach for realizing the aforemenƟ  oned vision, along with speciﬁ  cs 
about the implementaƟ  on requirements 
and the metrics to be used for quanƟ  ﬁ caƟ on 
and evaluaƟ  on of impacts associated with 
deployment and operaƟ  ons are outside the 
scope of the current solicitaƟ  on.

that seeks to understand the dynamics and impact of the built environment and technologies in the eﬃ   ciency of ciƟ  es and 
the quality of life of communiƟ  es.
• Outreach . UAB SSC educates the 
community on the elements of a sustainable smart city, and engages ciƟ  zens 
in transforming their built environment by acƟ  vely parƟ  cipaƟ  ng in the center’s 
research and educaƟ  on programs.
UAB Bill L. HarbertInsƟ tute for InnovaƟ  on and Entrepreneurship  
UAB’s InsƟ  tute for InnovaƟ  on and 
Entrepreneurship (IIE) improves the eﬃ   ciency 
and compeƟ  Ɵ veness of its research engine 
in an environment that fuels and sustains innovaƟ  on among faculty, researchers, 
students and community leaders. IIE helps to accelerate new company formaƟ  on and 
technology transfer through improved and ﬂ exible processes that build on successes of 
the UAB Research FoundaƟ  on (UABRF).  Since 
its incepƟ  on, UABRF has generated more than 
$64 million in licensing revenues and helped created 55 start-up companies based on products and technologies discovered at UAB.  IIE is bolstered by the InvenƟ  on-to-InnovaƟ  on 
(i2i) program. i2i is a joint eﬀ  ort by the School 
of Business, UAB Research FoundaƟ  on and 
Birmingham Business Alliance to market UAB assets with high commercial potenƟ  al.
InnovaƟ  on Depot
Opened in 2007, InnovaƟ  on Depot is an 
incubator and economic development program that hosts a shared co-work space facility in what was an abandoned Sears department store in the City’s Entrepreneurial Center just west of the city center. It is the Southeast’s premier technology business incubator, and is at the heart of Birmingham’s newly designated Eco-District. 
InnovaƟ  on Depot also host UAB’s Oﬃ   ce for 
the Advancement of Developing Industries. The 145,000 square foot space is designed to accommodate as many as 75 small businesses and up to 500 workers. However, demand has been high and there are currently 92 companies employing 540 people working under the InnovaƟ  on Depot banner. , In 
partnership with the City of Birmingham, InnovaƟ  on Depot conƟ  nues to work to support 
early stage technology companies, and has seen those it’s taken under its wing stay local. About 90% of the companies that go through the program stay close to home when they Become America’s Next Smart City

include companies such as RFID and Motus, a motorcycle company that employs an in-house designed and patented V-4 engine. The engine that Motus designed and developed the world’s ﬁ  rst direct-inject, liquid cooled V-4 
engine.  The company now manufactures from a facility in downtown Birmingham.
Workforce Readiness
The City of Birmingham has long been commiƩ  ed to workforce development and 
training.  Lawson State Community College is locat ed in the City of Birmingham, and is 
accessible by public transit.  Considered to be a historically black college and university (HBCU), Lawson State is a parƟ  cipaƟ  ng member of the 
Alabama Center for AutomoƟ  ve Excellence, 
and oﬀ  ers three auto mechanics programs 
sponsored by manufacturers - Ford ASSET, GM ASEP and Toyota T-TEN. These programs are designed to helps address the demand for skilled automoƟ  ve technicians, and reduce the 
talent gap between jobs posted and available workers to ﬁ  ll them. Ranked among the top 
50 best community colleges in the country, and consistently ranked in the top 5 of this group, Lawson State Community College also is one of the NaƟ  onal AlternaƟ  ve Fuels Training 
ConsorƟ  um (NAFTC) aﬃ   liated NaƟ  onal Training 
Centers.  NAFTC includes a naƟ  onal network 
of NaƟ  onal Training Centers which are post-
secondary educaƟ  on and training organizaƟ  ons 
that provide vehicle instrucƟ  on and a 
demonstrated commitment to move towards providing instrucƟ  on in alternaƟ  ve fuels, 
alternaƟ  ve fueled vehicles (AFVs), advanced 
technology vehicles, and related technologies. Since 2009, Lawson State has been training mechanics speciﬁ  cally 
in the care and repair of AFV’s and advanced technology 
vehicles to include electric vehicles.  Lawson State also is a top supplier of skilled labor to Alabama’s automoƟ  ve industry, and graduates 
have found gainful employment with Mercedes Benz U.S.A., Hyundai America, Toyota, and Nissan.
In 2011, Lawson State Community College 
was recognized by the Obama AdministraƟ  on 
as a Champion of Change for its work with developing the next generaƟ  on of skilled labor 
and providing a successful bridge between vocaƟ  onal and academic educaƟ  on. 
Lawson State Community College’s Birmingham 
campus will link directly with the Birmingham BRT, host a mobility hub, and connect to other area mobility hub(s) that are currently being planned as part of the City’s comprehensive planning process. It’s Bessemer campus will link with the BRT corridor as it expands west in future phases.
In addiƟ  on to training mechanics, there is a 
statewide push to by the Alabama Technology Network, the Alabama Industrial Development Training, and community colleges are trying to accelerate teaching speciﬁ  c technical 
skills. This includes teaching computer coding skills. Code.org, is naƟ  onal organizaƟ  on 
focused on increasing access to computer science educaƟ  on. Code.org is partnering 
with A+ College Ready and the Alabama State Department of EducaƟ  on, and will invest 
$500,000 to build on Alabama’s eﬀ  orts to 
expand computer science courses in K-12 classrooms across the state. The investment will double the number of Alabama teachers 
qualiﬁ  ed and trained to teach 
computer science in the state’s public schools. 
Our Commitment
Leadership. Since becoming 
Mayor of Birmingham in 2010, 
Become America’s Next Smart City
21William A. Bell, Sr. has steered the City into a 
new and exciƟ  ng direcƟ  on. AŌ  er inheriƟ  ng a 
$77 million budget deﬁ  cit, Mayor Bell quickly 
took control and began transforming the City, bringing about a renaissance of development and culture, and ushering in a new era of economic prosperity.
Under Mayor Bell’s leadership, Birmingham 
has made key strategic investments to spark growth and revitalizaƟ  on. The development of 
a new downtown baseball stadium -- Regions Field-- the Negro Southern League Museum, and conƟ  nued support of Railroad park has 
brought hundreds of millions of dollars of private investment to the thriving Parkside district and returned baseball to the City of Birmingham. Other investments, such as the Birmingham Crossplex, the Uptown Entertainment District, and implementaƟ  on of 
the Red Rock Ridge and Valley Trail System are 
currently spurring residenƟ  al and commercial 
growth in throughout the city.
Numerous corporaƟ  ons have r elocated to 
Birmingham or renewed their commitment to stay in Birmingham. This includes Healthsouth, Steris, Kamtech among others.
In 2013, Mayor Bell signed a memorandum 
of understanding with the University of Alabama at Birmingham Sustainable Smart CiƟ es Research Center to partner on projects 
that would make Birmingham a more livable city. Through this partnership, Birmingham received one of 16  (one of four in the United States) IBM 2014 Smarter CiƟ  es Challenge 
Grants aimed at eliminaƟ  ng food deserts in 
Birmingham.
Mayor Bell is not only changing the face 
of Birmingham locally, he is Birmingham’s ambassador to the world. He has served as president of the African American Mayors AssociaƟ  on (AAMA), co-chairing the U.S. 
Conference of Mayors CommiƩ  ee on Human Rights. He is also co-chair of “My Brothers 
Keeper,” an iniƟ  aƟ ve by the U.S. Conference of 
Mayors and President Barack Obama.
The Sharing 
Economy . The City 
of Birmingham is commiƩ  ed to the 
developing of its sharing economy, and will conƟ  nue 
to integrate transportaƟ  on 
technology soluƟ  ons 
so that they support these highly ﬂ exible economic 
networks.  The City already has made it easier to share resources on demand, supporƟ  ng 
the development of the awarding winning InnovaƟ  on Depot.
The City has supported the development 
of other co-working spaces such as REV Birmingham’s SocialVenture and 55th Place Arts.  SocialVenture is a f acility lo cated in the 
historic Woodlawn neighborhood that oﬀ  ers 
Birmingham’s entrepreneurs, non-proﬁ  ts 
and start-ups shared oﬃ   ce and retail space, 
and a divisible space to house meeƟ  ngs, 
workshops and recepƟ  ons.  55th Place Arts 
oﬀ ers customizable studio workspace for 
arƟ sts, makers, and other creaƟ  ves. All of these 
faciliƟ  es -- InnovaƟ  on Depot, SocialVenture, 
and 55th Place Arts -- are lo cated in proposed 
mobility hub locaƟ  ons. InnovaƟ  on Depot 
already has access to the Zyp Bikeshare program.; the other two locaƟ  ons are 
proposed to have access to Zyp Bikeshare and BRT.
In addiƟ  on to supporƟ  ng co-working space, the 
City of Birmingham also supports the Urban Food Project. The Urban Food Project aims to build a robust local food economy while creaƟ  ng healthy food access. The program 
Meeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
22assists corner store owners with shared 
resources that help them to purchase, market, market, and sell of fresh produce. The Urban Food Project addresses Birmingham’s food desert problems by assisƟ  ng Alabama’s farmers 
plan their crops and access underserved markets i.e. Birmingham’s food deserts, providing delivery services of quality produce to neighborhood restaurants and corner stores.
Finally, the City is supporƟ  ve of the sharing 
economy in that rideshare companies such as Uber, and LyŌ  , as well as apartment/
house sharing companies such as Air BnB are all now permiƩ  ed to operate within City 
limits.  Because Birmingham is the largest city in Alabama, its agreement to allow these businesses to operate within the City has opened up the sharing economy’s market to the enƟ  re Central Alabama region.
Our Process
Decision-Makers . A decision structure has 
been established that includes input from each of our key team members. A risk reward matrix will be established to allow the ranking of idenƟ  ﬁ ed components and opƟ  ons for speciﬁ  c 
projects during program implementaƟ  on.  
Each strategy and implementaƟ  on plan will be 
submiƩ  ed to the commiƩ  ee for review and 
ranked against the objecƟ  ve of the Smart CiƟ  es 
Challenge, as well as the available resources for implementaƟ  on.  Key decision factors 
include: a) opƟ  mizaƟ  on of exisƟ  ng assets, b) 
integraƟ  on with other program components, 
c) expandability, d) transferability, and e) the ability to advance Smart CiƟ  es Challenge 
objecƟ  ves speciﬁ  cally for mobility hub. This 
approach will allow for diverse input for selecƟ  on of technologies and approaches that 
best advance the City of Birmingham’s overall Smart CiƟ  es program, and generate outcomes 
with the maximum beneﬁ  t for the City. This 
approach also will idenƟ  fy acƟ  viƟ es that can 
be implemented in other jurisdicƟ  ons and naƟ onwide.
Each team member will idenƟ  fy one 
representaƟ  ve to serve on the commiƩ  ee 
and assist with alternaƟ  ve selecƟ  on. The 
commiƩ  ee will be chaired by the Mayor’s 
oﬃ  ce.
Program Management . The Program 
Management structure for the Smart CiƟ  es 
Challenge program will be put in-place from the iniƟ  al formulaƟ  on of the program’s 
objecƟ  ves, and will be implemented 
conƟ  nuously through the closeout of the 
program.  The Program Management Team will include:
• ndividual Project Management Plans
• Program Scheduling
• Financial Management
• Value Engineering
Our Risks
There are several potenƟ  al technical, policy, 
and insƟ  tuƟ onal risks associated with the 
deployment of the City of Birmingham’s Smart CiƟ es Challenge vision. While the risks are 
many and varied, most all of them might be avoided and miƟ  gated through thoughƞ  ul 
and careful preparaƟ  on, transparency, and 
educaƟ  on.  The decision -making and program 
management structure is designed to address many of the risks idenƟ  ﬁ ed herein. 
Our Systems
TransportaƟ  on Infrastructure . As of May, 
2014, the Birmingham metropolitan planning area’s funcƟ  onally classiﬁ  ed roadways were 
comprised of:Become America’s Next Smart City
23Transit Services . IFixed route and paratransit 
services are provided to the City of Birmingham by the Birmingham Jeﬀ  erson 
County Transit Authority (BJCTA). BJCTA operates 35 routes consisƟ  ng of a) 29 ﬁ  xed 
route marketed as MAX, b) one express route, c) two neighborhood circulators, d) one specialty shuƩ  le servicing the Birmingham-
ShuƩ  lesworth InternaƟ  onal Airport, and e) two 
downtown circulator routes.  All ﬁ  xed-route 
and paratransit services operate Monday through Friday between 4am and 11:30pm, and on Saturdays between 4am and midnight.  No services are provided on Sunday.
Shared Use Mobility Services . Several shared-
use mobility services are currently available in the City of Birmingham. Examples include Zyp Bikeshare, car sharing, CommuteSmart, and Commercial Shared Ride Services. Details about those services are available in “Our 
Vision”.
InformaƟ  on and CommunicaƟ  on Technology
The City of Birmingham is in the process of upgrading all its IT infrastructure that adhere to security guidelines and allows for a more robust and secure network plaƞ  orm. The 
City has already deployed VoIP (voice over internet protocol) communicaƟ  ons across the 
board with integrated uniﬁ  ed communicaƟ  ons 
systems.  Several ERP (enterprise resource planning) systems are already in place speciﬁ  c 
to ﬁ nance, public safety (police, ﬁ  re, courts), 
human resources, document imaging, body cameras for police personnel, and the ESRI GIS mapping system which integrates with our other ERP systems.
The City of Birmingham has already completed 
the required infrastructure, including the ﬁ  ber 
opƟ cs layout, to support NG 911 systems.  The

24City also has a built a traﬃ   c control center to 
maintain and monitor (24X7) more than 700 traﬃ  c intersecƟ  ons.
The City recently updated its web presence, 
incorporaƟ  ng a majority of “eServices” 
including: online business tax payment, parking Ɵ cket and traﬃ   c ﬁ ne payment, food truck 
vendor applicaƟ  on, etc.  An associated web 
app has been developed as well.  The City of Birmingham has also developed a public service web portal that will be launched in the near future.
Finally, the City of Birmingham is considering a 
GIG (gigabit) ﬁ  ber network “self-healing” ring 
deployment to the City as a whole that will provide high bandwidth internet connecƟ  vity 
to all City businesses and the public as well.
Intelligent TransportaƟ  on Systems . The City 
of Birmingham operates a Traﬃ   c Management 
Center (TMC) which is uƟ  lizing CCTV cameras 
to monitor traﬃ   c condiƟ  ons and control traﬃ   c 
signal intersecƟ  ons remotely in response to 
recurrent and non-recurrent congesƟ  on.  The 
TMC was updated in 2012 to include a new video wall, Ethernet switch, video management soŌ ware, work staƟ  ons, encoders, Ɵ  me servers 
and video wall servers.  This center is designed and set up to manage copper and ﬁ  ber cable 
plants.  It is the City of Birmingham’s goal to work in a mulƟ  agency/mulƟ  jurisdicƟ  onal 
manner so that the TMC’s reach might extend beyond the City’s boundaries, and aid with monitoring and collecƟ  ng informaƟ  on about the enƟ  re transportaƟ  on system using its 
network of sensors, cameras, and other technology.
ITS Architecture and Data Standards . 
Intelligent TransportaƟ  on Syst ems (ITS) present 
stakeholders with a variety of opƟ  ons in order 
to address a variety of transportaƟ  on needs. 
The framework provided by the NaƟ  onal ITS 
Architecture makes system, product, and service compaƟ  bility possible, without limiƟ  ng 
the design opƟ  ons of the stakeholder. As 
connected and automated vehicles emerge, expansion of the NaƟ  onal ITS Architecture 
and Standards is needed to provide the necessary guidance so that stakeholders develop systems soluƟ  ons that are compaƟ  ble 
in order to share data, provide coordinated, area-wide integrated operaƟ  ons; and support 
interoperable equipment and services where appropriate. The Connected Vehicle Reference ImplementaƟ  on (CVRIA) was developed to 
address this need.
As a Smart City, the City of Birmingham 
is commiƩ  ed to using the NaƟ  onal ITS 
Architecture and Standards as well as CVRIA guidelines to deﬁ  ne operaƟ  onal, user, Table 4. Birmingham Roadway System DescripƟ  on

25performance, and program requirements 
for the deployment of ITS technologies and connected/automated vehicle technologies as part of the implementaƟ  on process. 
Furthermore, the research team will document any exisƟ  ng gaps with respect to 
the use of currently available architecture, standards, and protocols in an eﬀ  ort to inform 
USDOT and standard seƫ   ng organizaƟ  ons 
about further needs for reﬁ  nement or 
development of new standards to support the adopƟ  on of interoperable architectures and 
integrated, fully open systems.
Our Data
Data Availability . To date, most of the data 
collected by the City has been historical travel data used for forecasƟ  ng and 
planning purposes. For the roadway system, Birmingham currently collects traﬃ   c counts, 
travel speed data, travel Ɵ  me data, and 
informaƟ  on on incidents and crashes. For 
transit, the City collects ridership data. For pedestrians and bicycles, the City has begun an eﬀ  ort to collect data on these modes 
through pedestrian facility counts. Automated data from the Zyp Bikeshare program is also now available and providing useful data on biking paƩ  erns in the City. Data are currently 
analyzed and warehoused at the Regional TransportaƟ  on Data Center, a partnership 
between the Regional Planning Commission and UAB.
 Data CollecƟ  on. The City will conƟ  nue its 
current data collecƟ  on eﬀ  orts in the future, 
but the goal as Birmingham moves forward will be to focus on:
• CollecƟ  ng more data from mulƟ  ple modes 
and sources
• IntegraƟ  ng data from other databases 
(e.g., medical, geospaƟ  al)
• CollecƟ  ng and analyzing data in real-Ɵ  me
• CollecƟ  ng data more eﬃ   ciently by using personal technologies and the smart city 
infrastructure to automate data collecƟ  on
• DistribuƟ  ng data and analysis in real-Ɵ  me 
to ciƟ  zens and stakeholder
These addiƟ  onal data will allow the City to 
beƩ er monitor the complete transportaƟ  on 
system in real Ɵ  me and shiŌ   resources as 
needed to accommodate changing demand or condiƟ  ons. This will require real-Ɵ  me data 
analyƟ  cs and distribuƟ  on, something for w 
hich the Data Center is beginning to plan.
Data Warehousing . Data will conƟ  nue to be 
stored, analyzed, and distributed from the Regional TransportaƟ  on Data Center. The 
addiƟ  on of the UAB Big Data AnalyƟ  cs Lab as a 
partner will enhance this eﬀ  ort.
Data Sharing . Because of the proprietary 
nature of so much transportaƟ  on data, 
sharing of data has been diﬃ   cult in the 
past.  Travel Ɵ  me data provided by the U.S. 
government, for example, cannot be easily shared with outside enƟ  Ɵ es due to ownership 
agreements. Similarly, freight data are considered proprietary by private carriers, who are reluctant to release any data related to actual types of freight moved. Even greater barriers exist with community health data, where personal privacy is paramount. One of the iniƟ  al, and potenƟ  ally most diﬃ   cult, tasks 
for the data center moving forward will be to assess these data sharing hurdles and idenƟ  fy 
the most eﬀ  ecƟ ve ways to resolve them. This 
will be no small eﬀ  ort, but will be essenƟ  al to 
future success.  The goal is to make data and analyƟ  cs available to local stakeholders in real-
Ɵ me.
The City of Birmingham is commiƩ  ed to 
publishing datasets online, in easy-to-use formats that can be analyzed, used and republished as needed.  An example is aggregated traﬃ   c accident data which includes 
locaƟ  on and Ɵ  me of day.  Currently, the City Meeting the Challenge to Become to Birmingham Rising
26is in discussion with the Code for Birmingham 
brigade regarding the establishment of an open data policy.
Data IntegraƟ  on. Data integraƟ  on will be 
performed with the support of the UAB Big Data AnalyƟ  cs Lab. With data anƟ  cipated from 
a wide variety of sources (highway, transit, freight, bicycle, medical, personal devices, and smart city infrastructure), integraƟ  on 
and analysis will require the development of protocols with the city and key stakeholders.
Our Influence
Through the Birmingham BRT, improved public transportaƟ  on services, Complete Streets, and 
pedestrian networks funding received from the Smart CiƟ  es Challenge will assist lower 
income residents climb the economic ladder to beƩ er long-term opportuniƟ  es for themselves, 
their families, and their neighborhoods.  The City of Birmingham intends to leverage the resources provided through the TIGER VII grants to catalyze reinvestment in the City’s neighborhoods, and redevelopment along the BRT corridor.
In addiƟ  on to the TIGER funding, the City 
of Birmingham has worked successfully with the Regional Planning Commission of Greater Birmingham (RPCGB), the metropolitan planning organizaƟ  on (MPO) 
for the Birmingham metropolitan area, leveraging federal funds for sidewalks, trails, roadways, and intelligent transportaƟ  on 
system (ITS) infrastructure.  The City’s work with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on the rebuilding of the PraƩ   Community following the April 
2011 tornadoes and the U.S. Environmental ProtecƟ  on Agency (U.S. EPA) in remediaƟ  ng 
the North Birmingham superfund site also are examples of how the City of Birmingham has leveraged federal funds.
The City of Birmingham also has a successful track record when it comes to leveraging 
private resources.  The construcƟ  on of Region’s 
Field and the Railroad Park in downtown saw the City working in partnership with the local business and development community to raise funds to construct these faciliƟ  es 
that in turn catalyzed the redevelopment of a once industrial area into a thriving enclave of young professionals, innovaƟ  ve businesses 
and entrepreneurs. Likewise, working with local non-proﬁ  t organizaƟ  ons such as the 
Woodlawn FoundaƟ  on, the City’s Woodlawn 
Neighborhood has transformed itself from one of the City’s worst areas into one of its most desirable.
Birmingham has successfully leveraged 
funding using such economic development tools and the Tax Increment Finance (TIF) districts and Capital Improvement CooperaƟ  ve 
Districts (CICD) to fund criƟ  cal infrastructure 
development and repairs.  The City is planning to use these tools to assist with revitalizaƟ  on 
eﬀ orts in the BRT corridor and at the BRT 
staƟ ons which are also the mobility hubs 
idenƟ  ﬁ ed in the Smart CiƟ  es Challenge vision.
The City of Birmingham and the State of 
Alabama are home to several ﬁ  nancial 
insƟ tuƟ ons that have both a naƟ  onal and 
internaƟ  onal footprint. These insƟ  tuƟ ons have 
a strong track record of providing philanthropic support and civic contribuƟ  ons that are 
helping to improve the overall quality of life for residents.
Finally, The University of Alabama at 
Birmingham which is a partner in this endeavor is commiƩ  ed to leveraging its relaƟ  onship with 
its research network and other local academic insƟ tuƟ ons to leverage their collecƟ  ve 
resources with private industry, parƟ  cularly 
within the State’s automoƟ  ve manufacturing 
industry to research and deploy Smart CiƟ  es 
technology and strategies."

Our Vision: A Resilient, Open-Access Transportation Super-Network
In August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall in New Orleans, and one of the largest domestic 
disasters in U.S. history subsequently tested the State of Louisiana. Hundreds of thousands of evacuees fled the devastation in a 70-mile journey to Baton Rouge. For many, that one-hour trip took days to complete due to the bottlenecked interstate and arterial road systems feeding into Baton Rouge. Our community welcomed these new residents, temporary or otherwise, but quickly realized the transporta -
tion system that had served us for decades was ill-equipped to support a sudden population influx of this magnitude. 
Even before the devastation of Hurricane Katrina took hold of our community, our then incoming and 
now current Mayor-President Melvin “Kip” Holden campaigned and was elected on a platform focused on applying short-term fixes that would help get traffic in Baton Rouge moving again – fixes that fol -
lowing such rapid population growth for our area became more acute. Innovative change was necessary in a way that would programmatically address this congestion issue, and Baton Rouge residents were desperate for a solution. Through the efforts of Mayor Holden, our staff at the City-Parish, and partners in the community, we developed what would become known as the “Green Light Plan” for street and road improvements. The innovation, and success, of this program cannot be understated as a precedent for what can take hold in our community when we organize around a cohesive vision and work to ac -
complish it. During a time when municipalities across the U.S. struggled to identify sources of funding for such transformative capital improvement programs, our leadership developed a program with a mix of innovative funding solutions, and our Baton Rouge residents responded in-kind by overwhelmingly approving to self-impose a 25-year, half-cent sales and use tax to fund the measures and projects required by this program.
From 2005 to 2016, under the leadership of current Mayor Holden, more than $600 million in the 
form of a comprehensive capital improvements program has been expended or obligated to fund road projects designed to increase capacity and connectivity across our road system. The reality is that while other communities may propose a set of solutions focused around innovation in transportation, ours is a community with a proven record of success. 
We have been there before and we are ready to do it again. And today, with such substantial transporta -
tion-related capital projects either complete or underway, we now shift our focus to long-term solutions. Imagine a mother and her two children leaving their home for the day to go to school and work. Rath -
er than taking their family vehicle, the mother uses a smartphone application to request a shuttle van 
that arrives promptly, whisking the family away. What she does not see is the algorithmic approach the application’s technology uses to define the most efficient route not just for this family, but for others in the shuttle, to get to their end destination as quickly and efficiently as possible. The shuttle van is able to maintain a speed of 40 miles per hour or more throughout its journey, with very few stops, thanks to application program interfaces (APIs) that allow the transit application to talk directly with traffic signals along some of Baton Rouge’s most heavily used arterial routes. This instinctive traffic signal function also helps minimize sit-and-wait time for transit providers or vehicles with a certain number of passengers. Game theory informs how traffic signals process other vehicles through these intersections in an intelli -
gent, real-time manner, ensuring that load-balancing is in effect at all times and traffic is processed effi -
ciently and safely through intersections – with data transmitted directly into an open-data environment that allows anyone to devise applications or additional solutions to add even more efficiency for travelers. 
In essence, traffic signals have become data sensors that communicate with other sensor-based technolo -
gies across Baton Rouge through the Louisiana Optical Network Initiative (LONI), one of the most ad -
vanced optical networks in the nation. These same signals communicate wirelessly with vehicles to guide 
the vehicle through intersections and smoothly navigate it through the network of arterial roads. Vehicles CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE2
are automatically rerouted when certain intersections experience heavy utilization that might cause traffic 
delays. This data is communicated to other networks, such as Louisiana’s statewide traffic system, to en -
sure non-local routes are able to incorporate traffic trends on high-volume routes like Interstates 10 and 12 – two key arteries for our dominant petrochemical and port-related shipping industries. Public and corporate policies work together to mitigate vehicle volume during peak travel times. 
These technologies were not simply identified and integrated into our local transportation system. They 
were applied and then built upon with technologists, developers, and traffic engineers competing to find better, more innovative ideas through new programs like the Transportation Technology Innovation Center, a joint program incorporating top talent from leading engineering programs at Baton Rouge’s two major universities – Louisiana State University (LSU) and Southern University (SU) – as well as the Louisiana Transportation Research Center (LTRC) and technology corporations like IBM, serving as a testing ground and innovation hub for new technologies.
Meanwhile, a few miles down the road, start-ups are working with local political leadership to create 
technology and operational solutions focused on traffic or transportation-related issues, all through an entrepreneur-in-residence program that co-locates entrepreneurs with City of Baton Rouge and Parish of East Baton Rouge (City-Parish) traffic engineers and programmers at City Hall. Through this incubation, collaborative teams focus on improving transportation data management and usage to develop solutions. These entrepreneurs are able to leverage unprecedented access to public sector data through the City-Par -
ish’s open data portal, which expanded from a leading portal for all mid-sized cities in the nation to one that serves as a data clearinghouse for all public sector data in south Louisiana. The portal coordinates with other key municipalities or parishes, which now have the technological capacity to track, manage, and ex -
port traffic-related data in a meaningful way through technical assistance provided by City-Parish officials.
In addition, Neighborhood Innovation Labs in economically disadvantaged areas throughout Baton Rouge 
work to solve similar traffic or transit-related problems, with a direct pipeline to area university programs and workforce opportunities. Meanwhile, the City-Parish’s commitment to fostering first-mile, last-mile solutions that build a comprehensive framework for public transportation have resulted in new transpor -
tation options, such as bikeshare programs with integration into the City-Parish’s open data environment, that connect to key transit hubs and provide alternate modes of transportation in high-density areas. 
That future of transportation in Baton Rouge is not all that difficult to imagine. When one begins to con -
sider every element of the transportation system as a data packet, with different utilities and needs from 
each, the flow of people and goods begins to look much more like a true network. In essence, traffic flow is being translated into a network topology, where data packets flow through routers and switches in a 99.9% uptime environment with redundancies in place for system spikes or crashes. And in Baton Rouge, where the infrastructure and resources already exist – from technology backbones and a history of solu -
tion-oriented transportation programs to a mix of leading industries, workforce talent, and top research capabilities – there is no place more poised to redefine the future of transportation in mid-sized cities by functioning as a test lab with inter-modality as a core focus.
Resiliency  is a quality in objects to hold or recover their shape, or in people to stay intact. Here in Baton 
Rouge, the application of that definition similarly holds dual meaning. Just over 10 years ago, the trans -
portation system in Baton Rouge endured a spike unlike most mid-sized cities have ever seen – one that 
sustained for months and years to come as New Orleans and coastal communities worked to rebuild in a post-hurricane environment. In a state that has experienced the full impact of four major hurricanes in the past 10 years, with greater frequency of high-impact events expected because of climate change and population growth, the unfortunate reality is that it is only a question of when the next disaster will strike. No other community is better positioned to develop and export a model for adaptation and response to unexpected, external events such as these. CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE3
This community is resilient well beyond the textbook definition. Investments must be made to ensure the 
City-Parish’s transportation system is placed on a path to recover from disruption. This kind of a resilient system is what we see as the future of Baton Rouge – a system in which people do not need to own a vehi -
cle to move around, and where a major event such as an accident on one of our major interstates does not cripple the rest of the transportation system. By integrating new, reliable modes of transportation ranging from bikes and trams to on-demand rideshare and transit to gondolas – in tandem with the significant resources and efforts that have been expended in recent years and will continue to take place in the form of capital projects, infrastructure investments, and a commitment to continuous performance improve-ment - the solutions outlined in this application can make this future a reality.
We firmly believe Baton Rouge is uniquely positioned to innovate and succeed as a demonstration project 
for mid-size communities around the country. Here are just a few reasons why:
A track record for innovation in how a clear vision, leadership, and community support can trans -
form a municipal transportation system
The necessary political drive, will, and leadership to affect the type of change typically required by strong levels of innovation
A friendly tax environment that incentivizes digital innovation
A struggling transit system poised to be re-imagined and serve as a model for how other mid-sized communities can similarly re-purpose their own transit systems
A strong academic foundation powered by leading universities and researchers laser-focused on devel -
oping innovative solutions for transportation issues
An existing fiber optic network that offers more than $50 million in infrastructure to facilitate light -
ning-fast data exchanges
Strong community-based partnerships that ensure innovative ideas are both executed upon and long-lasting, transcending political regimes
Innovative public-private partnership agreements between local government and cutting-edge tech -
nology providers
A unique geographic, multimodal landscape home to some of the nation’s leading industrial clusters and a rapidly growing technology sector
A dedication to strategic digital innovation and adoption of an open-government model rooted in how the open-sourcing and exchanging of data can positively impact a mid-sized community
The future of transportation in Baton Rouge is one without tradition – where doing things the way they have always been done is a mindset that is all but non-existent and where true innovation is taking place through a resilient, open-access transportation super-network that relies on grass-roots, community sup -
port and welcomes innovation. 
So how do we get there? Our blueprint is multi-pronged in nature, with a guiding framework and ca -
dence carefully designed to innovate, change, and transform in a way that any mid-sized community like 
ours can and should do. CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE4
Key elements of our approach include:
PHASE 1: Re-imagined and re-invigorated public transportation coupled with active public engage -
ment, strong public-private partnerships, and progressive regulatory policies all working to increase 
access for all transportation system users
PHASE 2: Smart infrastructure installation and conversion of public transit fleets to electric
PHASE 3:  Incremental adoption of electric, autonomous vehicles
PHASE 4:  A community no longer dependent on traffic signals or traditional means of facilitating 
movement through public spaces – one that is innovative beyond reproach and one that sets the stan -
dard for what all mid-sized communities should aspire to be
Background: Baton Rouge at a Glance
As both the capital city of Louisiana and home to Louisiana’s largest parish (county), Baton Rouge is one of the most – if not the most – unique mid-sized cities in the nation. Governed by a consolidated form of government, the City-Parish operates under the executive leadership of Mayor-President Melvin “Kip” Holden and is legislated by a 12-member Metropolitan Council (Council), with council members rep -
resenting various portions of the 471 square miles that comprise East Baton Rouge (EBR) Parish. Four chartered cities exist within EBR – the City of Baker, the City of Zachary, the City of Central, and the City of Baton Rouge – with the city limits of Baton Rouge encompassing 87.92 square miles.
EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH: KEY DEMOGRAPHICS1
Population  (2010) 440,171
Population density 934.546 persons per square mile
Persons per square mile (City of Baton Rouge) 2,607.131
Urbanized area in East Baton Rouge Parish 42.49 percent2
Median household income $48,506 
Persons below poverty line  (2009-2013) 19.2 percent
Mean travel time to work, workers age 16+ (2009-2013) 23.0 minutes
Commuters from outside Baton Rouge  (non-residents) 58%3
While the City of Baton Rouge operates as the consolidated seat of government for both itself and EBR, our application – and the problems it seeks to address – is intended to encapsulate any and all traffic is -
sues that exist across all 471 square miles of our parish. Just as water knows no political boundaries – an adage with which we in Louisiana are all too familiar – the same applies to traffic, from recurring areas of congestion on our interstate system to arteries that may move from free-flowing one minute to bottle -
necked the next. Over 58% of the Baton Rouge workforce commutes from outside the city. As such, any set of solutions focused on traffic issues must be one that extends beyond city boundaries and addresses the problem in a community-wide, holistic manner. With a population of 440,171 as of the 2010 United States Census, our parish and community embody the “mid-sized” definition as one that is small enough for innovation to exist and spread rapidly, but large enough that such advances matter tremendously. In our opinion, there is no better petri dish in the U.S. with the size, demographics, industry, and other characteristics as ours that can serve as a model for creating a transformational solution to solving traffic issues. That is the essence of each approach that we are proposing – a comprehensive solution with each element working in tandem, and one that is structured as a model to be defined, tested, and refined in Baton Rouge prior to being exported to other markets. CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE5
A community-driven approach
Our application was developed by drawing on the resources, intellect, and partnerships that are omni -
present throughout Baton Rouge. This application is community-based and community-driven, which 
we hope is evident by the numerous letters of support from political and business leaders throughout Baton Rouge provided in this submittal. When we began developing our approach, we brought together more than 30 of Baton Rouge’s brightest technology and traffic engineering minds to hear pitches, ideas, and technologies relevant to this effort – a discussion that led to tangible applications included in our proposed solution.
This proposal is not the first example of our community coming together to solve pressing challenges in 
Baton Rouge. In recent years, stakeholders have identified unique opportunities to move Baton Rouge forward by leveraging existing assets and infrastructure similar to those that we propose as valuable cornerstones within this Smart City approach. This collaboration is evident when looking at the develop -
ment of the Baton Rouge Health District, a unified medical community currently being formed to allow health care providers to combine their diverse strengths and compete with medical centers nationwide. The Health District is also implementing smart land use and proper transportation planning into its long-range vision. Or consider the Water Campus, which will create a world-class research center for the globe’s best scientists, engineers, and public and private businesses working to restore and protect shrink -
ing coastlines. They are developing scientific models of the impacts of sea-level rise and climate change to inform how we respond and ensure we are implementing sustainable solutions. Over $60 million has been committed to implement the first phase. When finished, the 33-acre campus will include approx -
imately 1.8 million square feet of research, office, commercial and residential space. Estimates from the Louisiana Department of Economic Development (LED) predict the Water Campus will house 4,000 new employees and create as many as 45,000 jobs in this entirely new economic sector for Louisiana over the next two decades. In each of these examples – both of which materialized quickly to move beyond planning – dozens of public and private sector partners came together to adopt a shared vision for growth and success. Truly transformative projects supersede the abilities of one entity and rely on a commitment from the community. This Smart City implementation will be no different. 
Strong, capable, and willing political leadership
One of the primary reasons initiatives such as the Water Campus, the Health District and this Smart City challenge are able to succeed is the willingness of our policymakers to be flexible and innovative. Our executive and legislative leadership firmly supports considering any policies required to achieve our desired objectives through this effort – from public policies that encourage user adoption to those that welcome innovative transportation disruptors to those that support technologies that connect vehicles to one another and supporting data hubs.
Our political and economic environment not only permits initiatives like these to take place, but wel -
comes them with very few inhibitors to stall progress. For example, in 2006, the Louisiana Legislature 
passed legislation to create the Digital Media and Software Development Incentive program, one of the nation’s strongest and most comprehensive software development tax incentives of its kind. For qualify -
ing companies registered to do business in Louisiana, the incentive provides an 18% credit on qualifying expenditures with an additional 7.2% credit on Louisiana resident payroll, and offers complete scalability – there are no minimums, caps, or expirations on the incentive. Effective July 1, 2018, this incentive rate is set to jump to a 25% credit on qualifying expenditures with an additional 10% credit on Louisiana resident payroll. To-date, hundreds of companies statewide have taken advantage of this leading differ -
entiator for Louisiana’s software development and technology industry, including those in Baton Rouge such as Stixis (100 new jobs), Electronic Arts (400 new jobs), and IBM (800 new jobs). In Baton Rouge alone, $75.8 million in expenditures have been claimed throughout the life of the program, resulting in CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE6
$25.2 million in credits issued to the area’s technology firms. Unlike many other cities, companies choos -
ing to locate in this area to design new software applications and build on our Smart City proposal will 
reap financial benefits through our innovative tax programs. 
In addition, the Alternative Fuels Tax Credit encourages the conversion of vehicles to alternative fuel 
usage for CNG, propane, and electric vehicles and further bolsters our claim to a regulatory environment that recognizes industry trends and welcomes a new age of automotive technology. This consumer-orient -
ed incentive applies a 36% credit to the conversion of vehicles to alternative fuel usage or, if a taxpayer is unable to or elects not to determine the exact cost of the qualified clean-burning motor vehicle fuel prop -
erty, he may claim a credit equal to 7.2% of the cost of the motor vehicle or $1,500, whichever is lower.
The success of these types of programs and a regulatory environment that welcomes a burgeoning tech -
nology industry has not gone unnoticed. In 2014, Business Facilities Magazine ranked Louisiana first 
in its Best Business Climate Rankings, remarking, “Pick a successful growth strategy other states are starting to replicate and you’ll discover that Louisiana has made it work on a grand scale. Nowhere is this more evident than in the unprecedented cooperation between higher education resources and business in Louisiana.”
A public transit system in need of an overhaul and poised to be re-imagined 
In Baton Rouge, the Capital Area Transit System (CATS) operates our public transit system, and the need for such transit services is highly acute. According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2010-2013 Ameri -
can Community Survey, 10.2% of households in the City of Baton Rouge are without a vehicle of their own, with that number dropping to 6.9% when considering the parish of EBR.
 4 With more than 1 in 
10 households in Baton Rouge city limits not having a vehicle of their own to get to work, the grocery store, or doctors’ offices, it is critical to have a robust, reliable transit system capable of filling that void. In addition, a tremendous opportunity exists in Baton Rouge to expand our public transit system to ac -
commodate riders of choice.
Consider the following:
An overwhelming majority of workers – 82% – in EBR drive alone to work in their vehicles
4
Over 28% of commuters in EBR drive alone to work and commute for over 30 minutes4
Only 1.7% of workers aged 16 years and over commute to work by public transportation4– well short 
of the 5.5% goal established by the Healthy People 2020 national health target 
In April of 2010, voters approved  a 10-year, 10.6 mill property tax – both a recognition of the transit 
problems and a commitment to fund solutions – which allocated $17.3 million in revenue to CATS’ 2015 annual budget, with total revenue in the same budget reaching just over $27.7 million.
 5 Re-purposing 
this funding and re-imagining our transit system could solve systemic problems in our existing public transportation system. Given that, along with ridership statistics and growth of our urbanized core, it is critical that solutions be put in place now in order to have a lasting effect in a fully functioning transit system. 
The epitome of strong community assets and multi-modal infrastructure
Baton Rouge boasts the necessary assets and infrastructure to ensure any community-wide models devel -
oped here have applicability to other areas in the U.S., as well as the institutional resources to innovate in a dramatic way. Our rapidly developing downtown area is situated along the banks of the Mississippi River, providing easy access to the nation’s ninth most active port, which handles nearly 60 million short tons of cargo annually.
 Additionally, our two major universities are in close proximity and offer CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE7
academic resources and opportunities for unique partnerships. Four major rail lines, an airport minutes 
from downtown Baton Rouge, and one of the nation’s largest petrochemical industries are also unique assets to our capital area. In addition, a $50 million integrated fiber network provides connectivity among universities into a single research and development platform, serving as a key asset capable of driving collaboration, innovation, and supercomputing activities across Baton Rouge. In essence, our inventory of assets and infrastructure offers a full-stack, holistic environment for the development of an exportable Smart City model.
PORT OF GREATER BATON ROUGE
As the farthest inland deepwater port on the Mississippi River, the Port of Greater Baton Rouge – based 
in West Baton Rouge Parish, just across the river from downtown Baton Rouge – serves as a key link between Louisiana, neighboring states from Florida to Texas, 31 additional states and two Canadian provinces, and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. Our local port jurisdiction is 85 miles of the Mississippi River, including neighboring Ascension and Iberville Parishes, with hundreds of millions of dollars in activity invested or committed in recent years to expansion-related activities. 
LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY
The state’s flagship university, LSU, is home to more than 30,000 undergraduate and graduate students 
and strong academic centers of education and research across a number of disciplines, including civil engineering, computer engineering, and computer science – bolstered by a $14 million investment from the state of Louisiana to increase the number of annual computer science graduates as part of a public-pri -
vate partnership between LED, LSU, and IBM.
 6 Through this partnership, in 2013, LSU’s College of 
Engineering committed to double its computer science faculty and triple its graduates during a five-year timeframe, with a goal of placing LSU’s Computer Science program in the top 10 to 15 nationally for B.S. degrees in computer science awarded annually.
LOUISIANA TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH CENTER
LTRC – a research, technology transfer, and training center sponsored jointly by the Louisiana Depart -
ment of Transportation and Development (LaDOTD) and LSU– is located on LSU’s campus and pro -
vides researchers and students with access to state-of-the-art laboratories and research equipment. LTRC 
is home to more than 90 employees and operates out of a 50,000-square-foot facility – that include two buildings – where scientists and engineers conduct advanced research on a wide range of transportation related projects to develop innovative engineering and technology-oriented solutions to Louisiana’s trans -
portation problems. The center has nearly 50 active transportation research projects involving investiga -
tors at LSU and other Louisiana universities.
SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY
Less than 15 miles from LSU, SU’s campus is home to more than 6,000 students and the university’s 
College of Engineering and Computer Science program with four programs ranked among the top 10 producers of African-American students who receive undergraduate engineering degrees.
 As a whole, the 
SU System is the nation’s only historically black university system, anchored by its flagship campus in Baton Rouge. 
RAILROAD INFRASTRUCTURE
Four major rail lines provide freight service within the Baton Rouge area, with routes ranging from 
north-south following the Mississippi River and Interstate 55 and east-west along U.S. 190. In addition, the Huey P. Long Bridge crossing the Mississippi River in Baton Rouge offers the only railroad bridge between Vicksburg, Mississippi, and New Orleans. CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE8
BATON ROUGE METROPOLITAN AIRPORT
With direct service to four major hub airports, the Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport (BTR) serves as a 
key connector between Baton Rouge and the rest of the world. In addition to commercial flight offerings, BTR’s Aviation Business Park is located on the north side of the airport and includes nearly 800 acres with current tenants ranging from the regional Coca-Cola Bottling Co. to the Mayor’s Office of Home -
land Security and Emergency Preparedness – home to our Emergency Operations Center, a high-tech facility out of which critical government services are delivered and managed during times of emergency or natural disaster. 
LOUISIANA OPTICAL NETWORK INITIATIVE
LONI is a unique, integrated fiber optic and high performance computing (HPC) system connecting 
every university, college, and major research institute in Louisiana into a single platform – representing one of the nation’s most innovative, integrated fiber and HPC architectures. Owned and managed by the State of Louisiana, LONI was conceived to accelerate research and education while attracting industry and government partners to Louisiana. With more than 1.5 petaflops of total computational capacity and more than 1,600 miles of fiber in the LONI network, LONI’s powerful cloud supercomputer resources provide an extremely enticing environment for any kind of activity – including the unification of data and computational capacity into a single platform. 
To date, over $50 million has been invested in LONI, making it an asset that can immediately be lev -
eraged to build, model, and power the technology and data-transfer needs of a smart city. In addition, 
LONI’s ready-made access points allow for easy connection from data sensors and swift integration into state and local traffic management systems thanks to existing partnerships between LONI, the LaD -
OTD, and the City-Parish.
AN ENTREPRENEURIAL ECOSYSTEM
In addition to the thousands of workers who power our area’s dominant petrochemical industry, Baton 
Rouge is also home to a growing technology sector. We boast an ecosystem of tech-savvy entrepreneurs with dozens of start-up companies based out of our two area business and technology incubators – the Louisiana Business and Technology Center and the Louisiana Technology Park, operated by parent organization Research Park Corporation. Operations range from Cellcontrol, which uses technology to protect drivers from mobile distractions, to Freebird, an app harnessing the power of interconnectivity to popularize and vet ideas for community improvement. 
LSU’s Student Incubator offers a similar environment to foster the growth of student entrepreneurs 
through dedicated office space, business consulting, and seed-based funding competitions such as the LSU Venture Challenge. The innovation offered by our university student base holds great potential to radically change both our transportation system and entrepreneurial community. For example, in Janu -
ary 2016, a team of LSU engineering students designed a hovering pod capable of traveling in a Hyper -
loop tube, “a concept promoted by inventor Elon Musk as a ‘fifth mode of transportation’ that is faster and more efficient than cars, planes, boats and trains.”
7 The team plans to raise private funds to build a 
model Hyperloop pod with final implementation connecting Baton Rouge and New Orleans.
Why Baton Rouge?
TRANSIT OPTIONS
Our CATS system struggles to meet rider expectations, improve upon its public image, and deliver ser -
vices in a way that grows its impact and reach among residents. Riders of choice overwhelming reject 
CATS’ services with only 13% of the entire CATS ridership choosing to use the transit system. While CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE9
these are the realities of our current system, we believe the integration of innovative technologies and 
related solutions outlined in this application can transform our public transit system in a way that can be exported to other mid-size cities similarly struggling with transit services. 
In 2015, CATS reported 2,742,387 unlinked trips through 30 fixed routes, up from 2,316,896 unlinked 
trips in 2013. Much of this increase is attributed to a change in service offerings, which were based off  recommendations outlined in a “Comprehensive Operations Analysis” of the CATS network. In January 2013, 20 routes existed. In March 2014, through the implementation of these recommendations, four transit hubs were added, 19 of the existing 20 routes were adjusted to meet user demand, and 10 new routes were added. 
Currently, 87% of CATS riders do not have a choice of whether to use the bus system, further demon -
strating the low percentage of riders of choice in our market. Over the years, operators of the system have 
worked to add more routes that may increase ridership from riders of choice. In recent years, CATS has tested park-and-ride systems and implemented several routes in neighborhoods whose residents are not considered typical public transit users; some of these routes have been successful, but most have not taken root in the community. 
Typical CATS riders use the system consistently and frequently. Ninety-three percent of customers use 
the system at least three days per week and 76% use the system more than five days per week. CATS is used largely by riders traveling to and from work, with 66% of customers indicating this as the primary purpose for using the system. Generally speaking, the demographics of CATS ridership indicate low-in -
come and minority residents are the primary users. Ninety-six percent of riders earn less than $50,000 annually, and 74% earn less than $25,000. Seventy-eight percent of CATS customers are black, and only 19% are white, compared to a parish-wide residential breakdown of 46% black and 49% white. 
In an effort to gauge rider needs and satisfaction, CATS has been completing customer surveys over the 
last several quarters that offer mixed results – while 81% of riders indicated that CATS goes where desired and 75% indicated that CATS operated when the rider desired, 51% felt that CATS did not have enough buses on each route, and 51% found that CATS buses arrived late. Establishing expectations for on-time performance and adhering to them is the top priority and service element for customers of a successful public transit system, and these metrics must be improved along with rebranding public transit in Baton Rouge to the point where these expectations are realized across both riders of need and choice.
CATS’ current window of on-time performance is up to one minute early and 10 minutes late. Based on 
this definition and rider survey data, if CATS achieved 100% on-time performance, 58% of customers would not be satisfied. Meeting on-time performance demands is a challenge for the bus system given the often unpredictable congestion within the City-Parish. If CATS could more reliably predict traffic problems, or otherwise be notified in real-time of traffic-related incidents, on-time arrivals could improve. Additionally, of the 83 total CATS fixed-route vehicles, 28 vehicles are past their useful life because of their age and mileage. An additional 28 vehicles, while they have not reached the end of their useful life yet, have recurring maintenance issues. Most of the vehicles currently in use run on diesel fuel. In 2013, the fleet consumed 550,978 gallons of ultra-low-sulfur diesel; fuel consumption in 2015 was estimated at around 855,000 gallons.
8 Vehicle repairs and breakdowns are critically affecting the on-time performance 
and rising maintenance costs, with CATS estimating a shortfall of $80 million for fleet and facilities improvements in the coming years. 
In addition to our bus transit system, we have begun to see exponential growth in shared-use mobility 
services for Baton Rouge residents – growth that has been very intentional on the part of policymakers. In 2014, a contingent of council members began actively working to recruit rideshare companies and establish ordinances that would welcome these operators to our market. These efforts resulted in Uber establishing operations in Baton Rouge shortly thereafter, with our City-Parish government sending a CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE10
clear signal to other innovators in this space that our doors and market are open for business. This mes -
sage and our approach to legislating and embracing these types of technological advances is very unique 
and atypical for mid-sized cities, and even here in Louisiana, where a community like New Orleans has endured a number of setbacks
9 related to implementing a policy framework for ridesharing services due 
to political controversy and opposition from traditional taxicab operators.
In July 2014, at initial launch, 30 Uber drivers were licensed to operate within EBR Parish. By the end of 
2015, 737 Uber drivers held licenses issued by the City-Parish. Additionally, with the increase in drivers, Uber has been able to decrease wait times from 12 minutes at launch to five minutes, demonstrating a strong presence in the community and swift measures taken by the industry to meet rider demand that has grown tremendously, with the community embracing this new service and experiencing little push-back from elected officials or others.

BATON ROUGE TRAFFIC CONGESTION
More than 500,000 people move through Baton Rouge on a daily basis which, when compared to our 
city of just over 200,000, demonstrates traffic load that greatly exceeds our residential population. Our parish-wide road infrastructure consists of 2,589 road miles: 210 of those miles are major collectors, 231 are minor arterials, 66 are minor collectors, and 246 are other principal arterial roads. Many of these roads are overly congested on a daily basis given the commuters (58% of our Baton Rouge workforce),
3 
freight trucks, and visitors who travel through our community en route to another end destination.
Mobility data collected by Texas A&M’s Urban Mobility Scorecard suggests that Baton Rouge is one of 
the most congested mid-size urban areas in the country. At a staggering 47 hours, Baton Rouge has the third highest yearly delay per auto commuter relative to other medium-sized urban areas in the nation. Similarly, at 23 gallons, Baton Rouge ranks third highest among medium-sized urban areas for excess fuel per auto commuter due to congestion. Even more notably, Baton Rouge has the largest congestion cost per auto commuter of comparably sized cities at $1,262 – nearly 1.5 times the national average of $870.
11 
The Urban Mobility Scorecard also tracks freeway planning time – the time that should be planned for a 20-minute trip in light traffic. With a score of 2.80, which represents a 56-minute planned travel time for a 20-minute trip, Baton Rouge ranks as the third worst performing mid-size city on this index.
11 Un-
fortunately, residents have been forced to adopt the need to plan extra time into travel – a regular delay that impacts access to health care, jobs, recreation, and basic quality-of-life.
CITY-PARISH INFRASTRUCTURE
The City-Parish is equipped with approximately 550 traffic signals that are part of a state-of-the-art sys -
tem that follows state and national architecture and intelligent transportation system standards. Given 
our current traffic signal standards powered by the Trafficware ATC controller, our signals can be up -
dated to meet future standards and innovations by installing software rather than requiring a complete overhaul of the signal infrastructure. Every traffic signal in Baton Rouge is equipped with cameras, de -
tection loops, or sensors so that traffic patterns can be determined and the signal timing optimized. All of our traffic signals have been updated to work autonomously. In addition, approximately 275 of the 550 signals include software that allows them to respond to external, real-time data to re-route traffic flow.  
Our central management system is powered by Trafficware’s ATMS.now, which operates our signal sys -
tem and is tied into the traffic signal optimization software. ATMS.now is a powerful tool for monitoring 
and controlling traffic control and ITS infrastructure, with an interface that allows us to bring traffic network data into a single repository for a real-time, integrated view of traffic operations. ATMS Maps in -
tegrate traffic data with Google Maps, Bing Maps, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to provide high-resolution imagery and other map layers for our traffic engineers, while Econolite Centracs stores CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE11
vehicular turn movements and allows for remote setup, diagnosis, and monitoring of traffic conditions. 
Additionally, signal communication is based on Ethernet fiber optics and wireless technologies, as well as legacy Ethernet over a twisted pair configuration. 
Our traffic signal system allows for two-way communications between the traffic signal system and the 
Advanced Traffic Management and Emergency Operations Center (ATM/EOC) – a key element to our ability to react in real-time to unplanned spikes or surges in roadway activity or emergency situations, as we have experienced numerous times in planning for or reacting to hurricanes and other disasters. Our ATM/EOC is a coordinated effort among the City-Parish, the LaDOTD, and the Federal High -
way Administration, which allows for the efficient flow of information among traffic signal components such as traffic signal controllers, malfunction management units, video detection cameras, emergency pre-emption, and uninterruptible power supplies via an Ethernet backbone. Given the importance of having a common operational picture for times of disaster or major traffic surges, our ATM/EOC facility serves a critical role in bringing together first responders (fire, police, and EMS), traffic engineering and intelligent transportation systems, law enforcement (local, state, and federal), emergency preparedness, the Capital Transportation Corporation (CATS), and 911 dispatchers.
12
Finally, while Baton Rouge is recognized as a Bronze Level Bicycle Friendly City by the League of Amer -
ican Bicyclists, our pedestrian and bike infrastructure is not up to best practice standards, with an overall walk score of 37 and an overall bike score of 47.
13 While many plans and developments are in progress 
to improve infrastructure, large-scale changes are needed to encourage residents to choose walking or bicycling instead of driving to nearby locations. 
DATA COLLECTION AND DATA NETWORKS
In recent years, the City-Parish has taken an aggressive approach toward adopting an open government 
philosophy and establishing an open-data environment capable of generating internal operational efficien -
cies and external engagement with residents, businesses, and even application developers seeking to leverage our public sector data. In January 2015, Mayor Holden announced the launch of Open Data BR , Baton 
Rouge’s official open-data portal, which received regional and national recognition for its robust catalog of high-quality, high-value data sets. Shortly thereafter, Mayor Holden announced the launch of Open Budget 
BR – a new, interactive way for residents to publicly access line-item information from the annual City-Par -
ish budget – and a revamped GIS program known as eBRGIS , which includes more than 90 on-demand 
GIS web services easily available for public access. In line with these recent advancements, we have placed a strong focus on developing a robust catalog of transportation and traffic related datasets.

In addition, our City-Parish GIS team is currently working with the Baton Rouge Police Department 
to develop and implement a Public Safety Common Operational Picture (PSCOP), a digital interactive mapping platform utilizing GIS technology. This platform provides a single source for users to access near real-time data and other information for coordination, communication, and analytics to support daily and emergency operations for public safety in Baton Rouge and surrounding metro areas. When complete, the PSCOP will encompass three strategic areas of public safety using the following mapping and data products: automatic vehicle location (AVL) for on- and off-duty police vehicles, crime incidents, traffic incidents, traffic cameras, critical infrastructure, special event road closures, population and demo -
graphics, and business locations. The design of this cutting-edge platform will serve as a critical compo -
nent to ensuring effective deployment and response to public safety and emergency situations, as well as a model for other agencies.
BATON ROUGE PUBLIC HEALTH
In 2013, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) issued transportation recommendations tied to improv -
ing overall public health. “Expanding the availability of, safety for, and access to a variety of transporta -
tion options and integrating health-enhancing choices into transportation policy has the potential to save 
lives by preventing chronic diseases, reducing and preventing motor-vehicle-related injury and deaths, improving environmental health, while stimulating economic development, and ensuring access for all people.”
14 Baton Rouge has room to improve in each of these categories and, in this way, can be a pilot for 
communities around the country to demonstrate innovations that result in meaningful change. 
Preventable chronic diseases like diabetes and obesity are highly prevalent in our community. In Louisi -
ana, self-reported obesity is fourth highest in the country at 34.9%.15 Baton Rouge has the highest obesity 
rate of the 100 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas as surveyed by Gallup and Healthways at 35.9%.16 
While there are many contributing factors to obesity, a lack of access to active transportation options and 
a fully functioning transit system are strong causative factors in our community. Louisiana has a diabetes prevalence of 10.8%, and EBR Parish has a prevalence of 11.5%
17. Diabetes and obesity account for $1.5 
billion in healthcare spending in Baton Rouge alone.18 Because of the high rates of these diseases and the 
enormous expenditures tied to their treatment, Baton Rouge must find innovative ways to improve health outcomes. Encouraging residents to change their daily habits will be critical to any effective public health intervention. Finally, Louisiana currently ranks last in the country for avoidable hospital use and cost.
18 
Limited access to transit options inhibits people from accessing health care in appropriate settings. Baton Rouge must improve its built environment by implementing more complete streets, and public transit options must be increased to offer more variety and flexibility to users. 
ENVIRONMENTAL VULNERABILITIES
Louisiana is one of the most vulnerable states as it relates to climate change. Approximately one football 
field of land is lost every 48 minutes along our coast, which equates to approximately 16 square miles a year. This loss is due to many factors, including climate change, drilling and dredging for oil and gas, and levees along the Mississippi River.
19 According to the 2012 Coastal Master Plan created by the Louisiana 
Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA), “Louisiana could lose an estimated 1,750 square miles of land in the next 50 years. This loss of land will increase flooding risk in communities across south Louisiana. It is estimated that annual damages from flooding will increase ten-fold over this same time period, from a coast-wide total of approximately $2.4 billion today to $23.4 billion in 2061.” According to the White House’s National Climate Assessment, our coast has the highest levels of coastal vulnerabil -
ity to natural hazard of any other area in the Gulf of Mexico.
19 
Baton Rouge has always served as a temporary haven for those in Louisiana evacuating from storm events and excessive flooding. In these peak population times, our transportation infrastructure struggles to support the heavier load. These data points on Louisiana’s sinking coast demonstrate the likely reality CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE13
that Baton Rouge will become home for many of Louisiana’s coastal residents in the near-term. We must 
be ready to welcome our neighbors and have a transportation system in place that can adapt to meet the needs of everyone. 
In addition to our increased flooding risk and land loss, Baton Rouge is currently classified as a non -
attainment area with ozone levels at 72 ppb. Under revised Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
standards of 65-70 ppb, Baton Rouge will remain in non-attainment status.
20 While several air quality 
improvements are underway, many large-scale industrial projects are expected in the region in the near term. The Greater Baton Rouge Industry Alliance has tabulated $23.7 billion in announced or underway industrial projects in our area. The Baton Rouge Area Chamber reported that 16,400 new jobs were ex -
pected locally in 2015.
20 This economic growth is a wonderful development for our community, but will 
necessitate innovative solutions to our air quality challenges. 
According to 2013 estimates by the EPA, “greenhouse gas emissions from transportation accounted for 
about 27% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, making it the second largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions after the Electricity sector.”
21 With our growing economy, the impact of transportation on 
air quality and climate change will only grow without innovations to reduce congestion and individual vehicle emissions. 
Commitment to Improve
Our community and leadership are poised for change and ready to embrace transformational approaches to our transportation woes. We recognize the need to move people efficiently, while enabling them to travel safely, economically, and bearing all users in mind. Furthermore, we acknowledge that our conges -
tion cannot be mitigated by simply building more roads.
In our most recent gubernatorial election, solving our transportation problems was the number one issue 
for voters.
22 Surprisingly, Baton Rouge’s traffic became a state-wide issue with each gubernatorial candi -
date pledging to address chokeholds in the capital city that, in turn, affect the rest of the state.23 Business 
leaders have joined together to form the Capital Region Industry for Sustainable Infrastructure Solutions (CRISIS) Coalition to promote and prioritize innovative solutions to the area’s traffic crisis. These busi -
nesses feel the negative effects from our community’s transportation challenges and expect these effects to worsen as the area adds tens of thousands of jobs in the next few years.
24
ADOPTION OF COMPLETE STREETS
In 2011, the Council adopted the FUTUREBR Comprehensive Plan, which called for the adoption of 
a Complete Streets policy. As a result of concerted efforts by local organizations, concerned citizens, and political leadership, the Council adopted a Complete Streets Policy in November 2014, and an ordinance creating a Complete Streets Advisory Committee to provide resident input was adopted in April 2015. The Advisory Committee will have its first meeting in February 2016. The Complete Streets policy re -
quires the City-Parish to give more consideration for things like sidewalks, crosswalks, bus shelters, and bike lanes in transportation projects. Under the policy, roadway projects “shall be designed and planned, to the greatest extent possible, to accommodate all users of the transportation system.”

IBM SMARTER CITIES
Baton Rouge was awarded technical assistance through the competitive IBM Smarter Cities Challenge  
and received a summary report in early 2015. The report described short-, medium-, and long-term rec -
ommendations that address implementing the appropriate IT platform to support a data-driven transpor -
tation planning process and focusing on smarter transport, smarter planning, and citizen engagement. 
Based on the report, the City-Parish intends to leverage data-driven intelligence about transportation CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE14
demands and new growth, while developing a strategy that includes stakeholders at the local, regional, 
and state levels. 
EPA BIKESHARE FEASIBILITY STUDY
In 2015, Baton Rouge received technical assistance from the EPA to evaluate bikeshare implementation. 
A task force of more than 20 stakeholders, including governmental agencies, local universities, philan -
thropic organizations, and resident advisory groups, contributed to the study. While there are many challenges to implementing a bikeshare program in Baton Rouge, the overwhelming consensus of the task force and final EPA study was that a bikeshare program is implementable and a critical link in Baton 
Rouge’s transportation infrastructure. Following the completion of the study, the task force has contin -
ued championing a bikeshare program and has engaged Toole Design Group to complete an implemen -
tation plan coupled with a detailed site plan and equity plan for the program in our community. This study will be completed by the summer of 2016 and will outline next steps necessary for implementation, which is expected in early 2017. 
NICHOLSON TRAM
Downtown Baton Rouge and LSU are separated by 1.5 miles of congested roadways, including Nichol -
son Drive. Nicholson in particular has several large-scale construction projects completed, underway, or 
slated to begin. IBM has opened an 800-employee service center downtown, the Water Campus is under construction, and the River District mixed-use development plans are being finalized. More than 3,700 housing units and 2 million square feet of commercial and office space will open in the coming years. Be -
cause of these impending developments and a strong desire for connections between LSU and downtown Baton Rouge, the City-Parish has proposed a tram to link the two together. In the fall of 2014, Baton Rouge was awarded a $1.8 million federal transportation grant through the TIGER grant program to study plans to develop a high-capacity all-electric transit system along Nicholson Drive.
26
GONDOLAS
In addition to City-Parish-led efforts, local entrepreneurs and nonprofits are looking to bring new modes 
of transportation to the community. For example, a Mississippi River Ropeways project is studying the creation of a gondola crossing the Mississippi River. Because many industry jobs are located across the river in West Baton Rouge Parish, but employees often live on the east side of the river, congestion along existing, limited river crossings is abysmal at peak transportation times. Additionally, the Baton Rouge Area Foundation (BRAF), a community foundation with nearly $600 million in assets, is investigating the use of urban gondolas in the Health District. Gondolas in this area will serve not only to enable visitors to the Health District to avoid traffic, but they will also connect these institutions to encourage collaboration. Since gondolas are cost-effective and can be implemented relatively quickly, they are ap -
pealing in our community.
BATON ROUGE-NEW ORLEANS COMMUTER RAIL
This major multi-modal project has garnered broad support from political leadership, local non-profits, 
and regional coalitions. Baton Rouge and New Orleans are becoming a super region where economic development and quality of life are intricately linked. More than 2.2 million people live in the region and 46% of the jobs in Louisiana are located within the corridor.
27,28 The region is projected to add 75,000 
new jobs by 2022, and already, 48,000 people commute between Baton Rouge and New Orleans daily.29 
Because of the growing exchange of human capital between the two cities, advocates from both are work -
ing together to promote the idea of a commuter train. Local and state elected officials have rallied behind the cause, seeing it as an economic boon for the region. Newly elected Governor John Bel Edwards has indicated his strong support for the project.

ELECTRIC CAR STRATEGY
Commercial Properties Realty Trust (CPRT), the real estate development arm of BRAF, is currently 
pursuing an electric car strategy in partnership with Louisiana Clean Fuels to promote electric vehicles in Baton Rouge. Through this program, CPRT will purchase vehicles for employees of BRAF and CPRT to utilize around town. The vehicles will be wrapped in electric vehicle promotional decals to increase community awareness. More importantly, the program will begin with the installation of 10 electronic vehicle-only parking spaces downtown and at the Water Campus with designated chargers. Entergy, a prominent power company headquartered in Louisiana, and Nissan are sponsoring several of these charging stations. City-Parish ordinances are currently being developed that will allow fines to be im -
posed on individuals without electric vehicles who park in these reserved spots.
PARKING METER IMPROVEMENTS
Baton Rouge is currently replacing all parking meters with smart meters so residents can go online to 
see available spaces, reserve spaces in advance, and pay for parking using smartphone functionalities or a credit card in lieu of spare change. More than 200 spaces in downtown Baton Rouge will be converted in the coming months. This important conversion is a step toward integrating the service with other trans -
portation options, the upcoming tram implementation and bikeshare program, to name a few. 
INNOVATION IN ZONING
In late 2014, Frank Duke was named planning director for the City of Baton Rouge. In his initial re -
view of the zoning code, he stated that “in [his] 30 years in planning and 25 years as planning director, 
[he’d] never found a development ordinance in more need of work.” Duke spent much of 2015 working on rewriting the City-Parish zoning code and intends to focus on a complete overhaul of the City-Par -
ish zoning ordinance in the coming months. A functioning and progressive zoning code is critical to a properly operating transportation system. To date, parking and landscaping zoning code updates are near completion. Duke intends to focus in the near-term on making Baton Rouge more walkable and accessible for all users.

Our Proposal
Today, we turn our focus to finding long-term solutions to traffic and transportation access with an emphasis on the next 20 years and building a model that other mid-sized cities across the nation can emulate. With traffic and congestion as real barriers to economic development for businesses and to residents’ quality of life, we recognize that the previous event-and-response cycle focused on short-term solutions is not enough. Instead, we must adopt practices and technologies for wider and more sustainable improvement. We must also integrate a resilient posture into even routine planning, engineering, tech -
nology deployment, and operational practices to allow agencies to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to decreases in functionality – no matter the cause, scale, or duration. Weather events such as hurricanes and flooding may come along only once every few years, but smaller events like traffic accidents and road construction that cripple interstates and stall bus lanes for even an hour happen almost every day. Having a resilient transportation system capable of adapting quickly and recovering from these types of variations is the fundamental goal of our proposal.
Ultimately, Baton Rouge will be home to a transportation super-network – a network that welcomes 
and supports autonomous vehicles and incorporates technology that not only allows drivers and vehicles (both autonomous and human-driven) to communicate seamlessly with one another and intersection control systems, but also incorporates real-time data from sources like cameras, road sensors, and weather stations to create easier, safer, and more reliable travel. This transportation super-network of computers, sensors, apps, and real-time communications will ultimately define what we mean when we reference CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE16
our goal of becoming a community with no traffic signals. With cars able to communicate with other 
information hubs as they move through the streets, traffic signals will become obsolete, metal vestiges of the past, replaced instead by tiny data boxes, hidden sensors, and invisible short-range communications. Imagine approaching an intersection during rush hour without the prospect of having to sit behind a line of cars, waiting and waiting to inch slowly forward to the front of the line. Even better, imagine strolling or biking and approaching an intersection unobstructed by hanging wires and flashing metal canisters.
Our dream of a community with no traffic signals is only 10 to 15 years away. Redefining the way our 
residents think about transportation is just as important as developing and launching the technologies. Today, multi-modal transportation alternatives in Baton Rouge are not yet available, and access to public transportation is limited, as are real-time traffic and transportation data. When faced with having to travel from point A to B, people in our community rarely consider any option other than getting in a gas-fueled car or truck, driving the route they know best (hoping but not knowing whether it is congest -
ed with traffic) and parking at their destination. Today, transportation in Baton Rouge is about vehicles and roads, with little opportunity for users to customize their trip or use data and technology to make it faster, easier, or more affordable. Changing this engrained mindset and transforming the systems and infrastructure that have informed it will take time. Therefore, this proposal is organized in phases, with each phase adding new modes of transportation and/or technologies, while at the same time exposing residents to new ways of using transportation and becoming critical contributors to and recipients of data in Baton Rouge’s transportation super-network. 
To successfully carry out our phased approach, strong public-private partnerships will be essential. Thus, 
we will work closely with private sector innovators, technology firms, engineers, and many others to develop, test and implement new technologies and systems. Our existing partnerships with companies like IBM, Ridecell and Trafficware will serve as robust starting points, but will be expanded, and new partnerships developed. We will also leverage key knowledge resources in our community such as LSU, SU, LTRC, and The Water Institute of the Gulf (TWIG) to research concepts and ideas, model and test new scenarios, and incubate new technologies. Each of these partners brings a great wealth of knowledge and expertise that can be leveraged and exported to develop and implement real, cutting-edge solutions to transform transportation in Baton Rouge. 
We acknowledge that today, Baton Rouge may lag behind many other mid-sized communities in trans -
portation with a transit system that disproportionately affects low-income individuals. However, our 
foundation in technology and infrastructure coupled with our community-wide focus on affecting change in dramatic, forward-thinking ways – reinforced by unwavering support from local and state officials and strong partnerships with critical stakeholders – places Baton Rouge in a position to uniquely benefit from this Smart City Challenge. Rather than slowly and gradually improve our transportation network, we instead have a unique opportunity to leapfrog various stages of innovation and potential bar -
riers to change, thereby implementing radical new technologies that will have quick and massive impacts on Baton Rouge’s overall quality of life, population health, and resiliency.CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE17
Implementation Plan
Phase 1 (Vision Elements 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12)
During Phase 1 of our implementation plan, we will focus on increasing access to and awareness of public 
transportation. By launching new, more adaptable and efficient ride services, multimodal options, and related technologies, we will increase public transportation ridership but also transform the mindset of a community that is overly dependent on private vehicles. Public outreach and education will be critical elements of this transformation. We will also use Phase 1 to lay the groundwork for further innovation through tools such as advocating for regulatory and policy changes and forming robust public-private partnerships to spur transportation technology research and innovation. 
RIDECELL TECHNOLOGY
As detailed previously, our public transit system has significant challenges. The integration of new tech -
nologies and operational models to the system could have an immediate, significant impact – not only on 
the ability of all riders to get to their destinations more quickly, but also on secondary indicators such as population health, the environment, and employment.
Over the past several weeks, leadership from the City-Parish and other stakeholders have facilitated a 
partnership with Ridecell, a San Francisco-based startup company that partners with transit agencies to reimagine transit, making it both easier to use and significantly cost-effective to operate. Through our partnership with Ridecell, we intend to incorporate Ridecell’s technology for on-demand, shared-ride services into the current CATS model. Using this technology, riders are able to request pickup at a spe -
cific location through an easy-to-use app on their smartphones. Riders without a smartphone can request a ride through the web or by a phone call to a central dispatcher. Ridecell’s technology is then able to find the most optimum driver, vehicle and route, based on a number of real-time data points – including traffic congestion, destination preference, and the locations and destinations of other riders in the area requesting pick-ups. For busier areas with multiple riders on a pick-up route, a bus might be the most efficient vehicle. For a route with only two riders, a smaller three or four-person vehicle that can navigate roads more quickly with a smaller carbon footprint may be appropriate. This same Ridecell technology allows for customization of almost every aspect of a trip, from start to finish. Customers are notified when a driver is on the way, receive a real-time estimated time of arrival, and can track the approaching vehicle via GPS. Fleet vehicles will continue to be owned by CATS and operated by public employees, using this new Ridecell technology. 
Initially, we may limit travel destinations to “dynamic transportation hubs” – places where riders can 
easily walk to their final destination or connect with other modes of transportation to do so. Baton Rouge PHASE 1  (1-2 years)

and community stakeholders have been working together over the past several months and years to in -
troduce multiple new transportation modes to our portfolio. We anticipate a formal bikeshare program 
launching in early 2017; carshare companies are actively exploring Baton Rouge; gondolas are envisioned for use in key corridors; a tram line recently received federal funding for planning; and passenger rail service between Baton Rouge and New Orleans is imminent. Dynamic transportation hubs will be co-lo -
cated with these multi-modal transit opportunities so that riders arriving at one of the proposed hubs can connect with any one of these new multi-modal transportation options or other fixed bus routes to reach their ultimate destination.
With numerous smart growth and well-planned developments underway in Baton Rouge, we will be able 
to locate many of these dynamic hubs in areas with pedestrian-friendly infrastructure such as bike paths and sidewalks. These transportation hubs will not be permanent, heavy infrastructure facilities similar to the bus stations we know today. Instead, they will operate like interim coordination centers where riders in a particular area link up with their most efficient last-mile option. The hubs could easily and cost-effectively be moved to different locations within Baton Rouge to reflect changing rider demand and accommodate new development. Moreover, we propose introducing a new, integrated payment system through Ridecell’s technology that will allow riders to pay for multiple transportation options through a single smartphone app. Riders will be able to set up a single account “loaded” with transportation credits that can be used on any number of transportation options (bikeshare, carshare, trams, trains, and gon -
dolas), whether run by the City-Parish or not. The system will also allow the City-Parish or third-party vendors to apply subsidies, discounts, or vouchers for designated users, including low-income riders that might qualify for certain benefit programs.
Over time, as ridership increases and the system becomes more efficient, we will add a point-to-point 
component that allows riders to use the Ridecell technology not only to reach transportation hubs, but also to travel directly to their final destination. Two significant advantages of the Ridecell technology are the ability to collect reliable, real-time data about users, routes, traffic patterns and travel times, and the ability to quickly and easily scale the system up or down, depending on demand, as well as the number of available drivers and vehicles. In areas with high concentrations of elderly riders, for example, we may want to move quickly to point-to-point service that allows riders to bypass transportation hubs and avoid switching travel modes. For student housing areas near LSU where most riders are trying to reach the same general destination, it may be more efficient to limit service to shared rides to dynamic transporta -
tion hubs on or near campus. In fact, Ridecell technology will allow us to create one or multiple smaller transportation networks within our larger parish-wide network, such as shared-ride networks for LSU, SU, or the thousands of State of Louisiana employees working downtown. Simply put, this technology will allow our transportation system to respond to demand and resource availability in ways that are not possible in our existing static model.
This dynamic transit model that our partnership with Ridecell will allow us to introduce in Baton Rouge 
will have numerous positive impacts. First and foremost, by seamlessly integrating on-demand with mass transit, the technology will help increase access to and ridership of public transportation. Based on avail -
able data and initial conversations with CATS leadership, Ridecell estimates its technology could double, even triple, ridership. Moreover, we believe the technology will increase access for all users as the Ridecell 
platform is capable of generating route options based on a rider’s unique situation. Riders may desire the cheapest route alternative, the route alternative with the fewest transfers, or even the fastest time to destination. Because Ridecell will be able to link users to new modes of transportation, both physically and via their technology, end users will be better informed in making decisions about how they travel. In addition, by cutting down on wait and travel times, reducing the number of transfers required, and introducing customized vehicles and routes, many middle- and upper-income riders who today do not consider public transportation a practical or desirable option may become more open-minded to doing so. Second, Ridecell will allow CATS to access a plethora of data to optimize cost and maximize value. CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE19
Average wait time, average route time, top locations, requests by hour/day/month, and usage per student/
employee are examples of data points that CATS can use to scale and adjust the system to create the most efficient model at any given moment in time. Third, by allowing users to track approaching vehicles, rid -
ers can wait safely inside their pick-up location rather than outside for long periods of time at a bus stop. Finally, with customized vehicles whose ridership is maximized, large buses will not run on fixed routes that do not attract users and emit unnecessary greenhouse gases. Shared rides in more efficient vehicles will minimize impact on our climate and air quality, even before we move to an all-electric fleet.
In addition to incorporating Ridecell technology, we will launch several other initiatives during this ini -
tial implementation phase to lay the foundation for future innovations and technologies. 
PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT TO REACH CONNECTED, INVOLVED CITIZENS
We plan to launch an aggressive public outreach and education campaign to increase awareness about 
accessing and using public transportation. Residents must understand how this new technology works and how it will facilitate a transportation alternative that is affordable, easy-to-use, and will allow them to customize their trip and their data to directly impact how our public transportation system works. Enticing new riders to use public transportation will not happen overnight. CATS must overcome a struggling brand and educate the public on the innovative technologies that will now be employed. Both current and future users of the system will need to easily understand the benefits, backed up by convinc -
ing, sound data. 
IMPROVEMENT OF FIRST/LAST MILE INFRASTRUCTURE  
TO EXPAND USER-FOCUSED MOBILITY CHOICES
Implementing the dynamic transportation model outlined above will not be possible without an exten -
sive, reliable network of first- and last-mile infrastructure that allows riders to connect to their final desti -
nation. Several initiatives are already underway, with some such as a bikeshare program and trams being 
closer to implementation than others. Regardless of the specific mode of transportation, there must be vigorous collaboration among stakeholders, including public officials, nonprofits, and the private sector. Champions who appreciate these first- and last-mile solutions as necessary components of a seamless, con -
nected transportation network must be identified and must work closely with the City-Parish to integrate these alternatives. We believe our letters of support demonstrate a willingness of many partners to lead these projects.
REGULATORY AND POLICY CHANGES TO FOSTER INNOVATION  
AND ESTABLISH WELL-DEFINED STANDARDS
We will also begin working with local, state and federal officials and policymakers, as well as private 
sector players, to develop and implement policy changes needed for future phases of innovation. In the short-term, policies like staggered start times, programs to incentivize using public transportation, and ride-sharing can be integrated within corporate policies in our local industry. As detailed later in this application, we intend to develop a transportation network that invites and supports vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, and other cutting-edge technologies. A thorough survey of existing ordinances, laws, regula -
tions, and zoning codes must be conducted to ensure our regulations do not limit or hamper innovation, nor the deployment of new technologies on our roads. Moreover, we must begin engaging policymakers and industry experts, from engineers to computer scientists, to develop new standards that embrace and integrate national standards like CVRIA and other existing ITS standards. We have already initiated discussions with companies like Google and IBM to begin thinking about these issues and developing a public policy strategy to ensure Baton Rouge is well-positioned for autonomous car technology. In addition, our City-Parish and other stakeholders are already researching necessary changes to existing regulations to accommodate and incentivize electric vehicle use. With employers investing in electric CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE20
vehicle fleets and the prospect of converting our public fleets to electric vehicles in the near future, we 
acknowledge that special electric vehicle parking and charging regulations must be implemented quickly. As evidenced by our pledges of support, local officials and policymakers stand ready to do their part to move the needle forward in Baton Rouge and establish our community as a desirable place for innovators in transportation to do business.
PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES FOR PLANNING, INNOVATION AND URBAN ANALYTICS
Unlike many other mid-sized cities, Baton Rouge is fortunate to have several strong educational and 
research institutions who are eager to export their knowledge to help transform transportation in our community. We have also established a very friendly regulatory and tax framework in Louisiana that en -
courages digital innovation in areas such as cloud computing, software development and mobile applica -
tions. This framework has incentivized companies like IBM and smaller start-ups to make Baton Rouge their home. These companies and many others who may not yet operate in Louisiana must be partners whose knowledge and innovations can be leveraged and deployed in Baton Rouge.
Both LSU and SU have pledged their support of this proposal and expressed their desire to serve as key 
partners with the City-Parish and other stakeholders. Through this effort, we will create a Transportation Technology Innovation Center in which LTRC, LSU’s high-performing engineering school, SU, TWIG, private sector innovators and public sector policymakers operate as partners under one organization fo -
cused solely on transportation innovation that can be developed in Baton Rouge and exported through -
out the country.
Other, more narrowly focused partnerships will prepare our current systems and infrastructure for new 
technology and innovations. Regardless of the specific technology we implement, we will need to collect, analyze, share and disseminate huge amounts of data. Real-time rider, driver, traffic and weather data, as well as signal-to-signal, V2I, and V2V communications, are just a few of the datasets that new technolo -
gies generate and need to operate effectively. A thorough analysis of the large data capacity needs of our system of the future, and decisions about how data will be managed and shared, who will adjust systems based on data, and how we convert data to usable information for the public will require a great deal of collaboration among the City-Parish and stakeholders – especially those with expertise like IBM. We will also expand our successful Open Data BR portal from one that currently aggregates and publishes only City-Parish data, to a central open-source hub for data across our nine-parish capital region. Technical assistance will be provided to the parishes and municipalities surrounding Baton Rouge to help those with fewer resources adopt similar approaches, workflows, and systems for capturing data and integrating it into our own, thereby truly creating a one-stop shop for public sector data that supersedes political and geographic boundaries.
We will establish an entrepreneur-in-residence program to encourage greater collaboration between 
the City-Parish, State, and businesses engaged in technology innovation, help bring fresh ideas to the City-Parish, and give entrepreneurs a chance to enter the public-sector technology market. Teams of entrepreneurs might spend several weeks or months working side-by-side with local officials on their se -
lected projects. By aligning goals and working in the same physical space, officials and entrepreneurs can more efficiently leverage data, use public assets, and improve transportation. Such a program would also help Baton Rouge establish a reputation among peer cities and entrepreneurs as a place where innovation is encouraged and can easily be leveraged and deployed.
Additionally, neighborhood Innovation Labs will be created in at-risk, low-to-moderate income areas of 
our community focused on both neighborhood revitalization as well as cultivating residents’ skills to pos -
itively affect changes and solutions to our area’s noted traffic-related issues. These labs will be identified in conjunction with the Office of the Mayor-President, Office of Community Development, and the May -
or’s Blight Elimination Team based on available infrastructure within these communities, leveraging land CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE21
and facilities owned by the City-Parish – including blighted housing set for auction or demolition – that 
are remodeled and repurposed into micro-incubators with areas for classroom-style learning, computer labs, and demonstration areas. Technical assistance such as computer coding classes will be provided to interested residents, with City-Parish traffic engineers and IT specialists providing hands-on support for project-based learning and business consulting provided to those seeking to turn ideas into a business. Not only will these micro-incubators serve as an important neighborhood revitalization and workforce development measure, but they will also provide another layer of solutions fully oriented toward solving community-wide traffic and transportation issues.
Phase 2 (Vision Elements 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 11)
CONNECTED VEHICLES 
With access to dynamic, on-demand shared transportation available and strong partnerships for innova -
tion in place, we will shift our focus in Phase 2 to introducing new infrastructure and technologies that 
will optimize the flow of motorists, pedestrian traffic, and freight in order to create the transportation su -
per-network we ultimately envision for Baton Rouge. This infrastructure will tap into LONI so that data is shared instantaneously across the state for research and analysis. We also plan to harness the capabilities of LONI to facilitate real-time data capture and integrate these data into one central data exchange with a focus on publishing for real-time public access. The establishment of this transportation-related data exchange and interface is consistent with recommendations offered by IBM as part of the 2014 Smarter Cities Challenge grant awarded to our City-Parish. We will also continue to increase electric vehicle infra -
structure and technologies so our transportation system is not only redundant, affordable, safe, efficient and adaptable, but also environmentally resilient and sustainable.
Vehicle manufacturers are developing and launching new technologies that directly link vehicles to their 
physical surroundings, including traffic signals and traffic management centers, pedestrians, other vehi -
cles and emergency management, to improve safety and allow for more optimal routes. Manufacturers like Audi, BMW, GM and Tesla are already incorporating a number of technologies that will allow their vehicles to communicate with traffic signals over a combination of WiFi and 3G mobile by 2017. With this technology, for example, traffic signals can send out timing information to cars that then provide messages to drivers to help them optimize driving so they do not have to stop as often or can automati -
cally turn their vehicles on and off at red lights to reduce emissions. As noted above, Baton Rouge’s traffic infrastructure already includes traffic signal software that controls signals and transmits data to signal timing optimization software. With this new system, Baton Rouge’s existing traffic server will replicate data in real-time to a second firewalled server. Vehicle infrastructure developed by auto manufacturers will tie into the second server and send that data straight to their vehicles.  With hardware largely in place and a network established in the community, Baton Rouge is well-situated to incorporate this new technology into its existing traffic management system, with very few modifications and at a relatively low cost.
Baton Rouge also stands ready to embrace V2V communication technology. IBM, which is invested in 
Baton Rouge and committed to serve as a long-term partner to the City-Parish, is already conducting research and traffic pilots to demonstrate how connected cars automatically share and broadcast dozens of data points, such as the car’s location, speed, heading, brake status, and other data to nearby vehicles within a few hundred meters. Other cars can use this information to build a detailed picture of what is unfolding around them, revealing trouble that even the most careful and alert driver, or the best sensor system, would miss or fail to anticipate. Through IBM’s partnership with Baton Rouge, we will leverage this knowledge and work closely to ensure our data analytics and processing systems are equipped to support all connected vehicle technologies. CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE22
This technology will transform the driver experience in Baton Rouge. As a driver approaches an inter -
section, he will be alerted that the light is going to turn red in 10 seconds. The driver may use this infor -
mation to begin slowing down, creating a safer approach for the driver and others. Once the vehicle is 
stopped, the driver may opt for the vehicle to automatically shut down or enter an efficiency mode until the light turns green again. Alternatively, the driver’s vehicle GPS device may suggest the driver turn before the intersection to avoid the congested intersection altogether and re-route the driver to a more optimal route. Moreover, in addition to the traffic signal pushing data out to vehicles and drivers, the signal will also become a major receiver of data that it can use to optimize routes and create safer condi -
tions for all vehicles. Signal-to-signal communications, for example, will allow signals to receive real-time information about surrounding traffic counts and congestion points so that signal timing can change to re-route vehicles on optimized routes. Baton Rouge is already engaged in discussions with Trafficware about expanding our existing partnership to include this connected vehicle technology, and LaDOTD is working to make this software platform their state-wide system, which makes the concept even more deployable as it could readily be expanded to state-wide implementation.
Baton Rouge is also uniquely situated to realize greater benefit from a V2I communication system be -
cause of the area’s high concentration of heavy industry – primarily our Mississippi River port opera -
tions and the huge number of petrochemical plants situated along the River. Today, hundreds of large 
petrochemical transport trucks carrying hazardous cargo navigate Baton Rouge’s roads and interstates with nothing more than a traditional GPS device to guide them to their destination. City-Parish traffic engineers report that these transporters frequently end up driving through residential areas with narrow streets not designed for heavy trucks or equipment. Traffic is routinely backed up when the transporters get stuck trying to make sharp turns, and chemical spills on our highways and interstates are all too fre -
quent news stories. Advanced V2I software could easily be adapted to route these heavy industry vehicles to designated truck lanes and away from dense residential areas, congested highways and potentially dan -
gerous environments, creating a safer road network for all drivers. Moreover, once V2V communication technology is deployed, other drivers can be notified of nearby transport vehicles, yet another opportuni -
ty to help reduce the number of potentially dangerous collisions and spills.
Just as large trucks carry enormous amounts of hazardous petrochemicals through Baton Rouge, so do 
railroads. Four major railroad lines run through the Baton Rouge area, primarily carrying petrochemicals to and from nearby plants and refineries. These trains run often, and cross traffic at 217 locations in the parish. Some of the crossings have upgraded safety features, but others do not, and the consequences of collisions with these hazardous materials are significant. Deploying V2I and V2V will not only create safer crossings, but will also create more efficient and adaptive traffic flow in the surrounding areas. Cross -
ing lights or trains themselves equipped with connected vehicle software could easily communicate with drivers and vehicles about approaching trains before reaching a crossing, not only alerting drivers of the approaching train, but also allowing vehicles to automatically re-route drivers to a more optimal path to their destination.
V2I and V2V communication technology can also be used in Baton Rouge to create a more responsive 
and adaptive system that prioritizes certain categories of vehicles and responds to rider demand and exter -
nal factors. Just as we propose to customize connected vehicle technology to guide petrochemical trans -
porters to specific routes, we can give priority to emergency response vehicles, school buses, shared-ride public transportation vehicles, or evacuation buses during disasters. Today, ambulances approaching an intersection use an infrared beam to communicate with the traffic signal up to 2100 feet away, prompting the signal to turn green. Unfortunately, the ambulance cannot communicate with the next signal until it fully passes through the first intersection and, if turning, completes the full 90-degree turn and comes within 2100 feet of the next signal. Technology allowing these response vehicles to communicate with signals and other nearby vehicles from the moment they are deployed will help create safer and quicker response times, as intersections can adjust along the route using priority signal operations well in advance CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE23
of the response vehicle’s arrival. Because the system will allow signals to talk to one another and commu -
nicate priority changes, it will maintain coordinated traffic flow on roadways along the emergency route, 
thereby minimizing disruptions to cross-street traffic.
Based on our successful deployment of this smart infrastructure along locally owned roads, we will work 
with our counterparts at LaDOTD to implement smart highway infrastructure along state-owned road -
ways that will be linked into the LONI network. This increased collaboration will allow for a completely integrated data system utilized seamlessly by drivers along roadways.
Lastly, there are opportunities to deploy V2I and V2V communication technology in Baton Rouge to 
help eliminate unique risks associated with our community’s environmental vulnerabilities. Communi -
ties across south Louisiana, including Baton Rouge, are more vulnerable to flooding and extreme weather events than almost any other area in the world. With new technologies, real-time weather data will be communicated not only to traffic signals but also to drivers and vehicles. GPS, satellites and even road sensors can alert traffic signals to shift drivers off flooded roadways or avoid areas where dangerous weath -
er is approaching, while V2V communications could alert other travelers to avoid certain areas. While numerous weather apps exist in the market today, the communication of detailed, granular data about specific dangerous road conditions will add a new level of safety and resiliency to our transportation system. Recently, IBM announced its acquisition of The Weather Channel’s product and technology business. IBM’s data analytics and cloud services, coupled with The Weather Channel’s massive weather data services platform, create a unique opportunity to develop technologies to minimize disruptions and inform decision making around extreme weather events. With IBM as a partner, we believe Baton Rouge has a unique opportunity to serve as a testing ground for this type of innovation.
With the cataloguing of all of this new data, the City-Parish will create a robust website and related smart 
phone app to provide user-friendly, real-time data to users and to gather individual user data that can be pushed out to optimize transportation modes. The raw data collected from smart infrastructure and vehi -
cles will be repurposed as usable information for residents, while also being pushed out to the applications drivers are most likely to turn to for traffic assistance.  Similarly, real-time data gathered from users will provide valuable information about location and demand. The gondola system we propose, for example, will be connected to this information system, with gondola cars easily added to the system or the speed increased when data indicates foot travel in the area is heavy.
ELECTRIC VEHICLES 
CATS recently commissioned the University of New Orleans Transportation Institute to prepare an Al -
ternative Fuels Assessment designed to examine the pros and cons of various alternative fuels. The assess -
ment recommended that CATS move towards a fully electric bus fleet, noting that “the long-term bene -
fits of such an electric system far outweigh the cost of the technology.”  The report detailed the numerous 
benefits of moving to this fuel source. First, electric buses have zero tailpipe emissions, which means less impact on the environment as well as offering the best option for earning revenue from emission credits. Second, while electric buses were the most capital-intensive option examined, they are the cheapest to operate and maintain since the cost of electricity is significantly lower than the cost of any other fuel on a per-mile basis, and electric motors are more durable than internal combustion engines – so long-term maintenance costs would be lower. The report concluded the savings in fuel and maintenance costs would actually save CATS money over the course of 30 years, despite the high capital expense associated with converting to electric. Since the report, CATS has continued to investigate electric fleet options.
Multiple electric fleet vendors, including Proterra, have expressed interest in working with CATS to be -
gin converting to electric. Proterra’s electric buses and charging equipment enable customers to select the 
right amount and type of energy storage to meet specific route requirements, with battery packs located underneath each bus. Charging stations are low-impact and resemble street lights. The vehicles utilize CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE24
wireless charging technology and can be configured for both on-route and depot charging at a variety of 
rates to maximize charging opportunities. The system also allows for easy battery pack reconfiguration so batteries can be switched out depending on operational needs. Fast-charge batteries can be recharged on-route in less than 10 minutes, or fast-charge configured buses can be charged in-depot (or even at curbside pullouts or in buildings) to take advantage of off-peak charging times. This option allows buses to travel over 700 miles in 24 hours. Conversely, buses configured with extended range batteries could travel up to 180 miles between charges.
Although Proterra’s technology does not currently include linking electric charging to solar power, Pro -
terra is already working towards this innovation. Estimates show that using solar panels, positioned 
efficiently on the rooftops of transportation hubs and stations, for example, would reduce the annual op -
erational cost of an electric fleet vehicle by approximately 50% (from about $100,000/year for electric or $50,000/year for solar-electric vs. $450,000/year for diesel). Louisiana’s generous electric conversion and solar tax credits, as well as steadily decreasing solar panel installation costs, make converting vehicle fleets to electric even more cost-effective. For smaller vehicles, Louisiana offers an electric conversion tax credit of 36% of the cost of the qualified clean-burning motor vehicle fuel property. Larger, more expensive ve -
hicles, such as bus fleets, would need to be negotiated with the Louisiana Department of Revenue. Tesla currently operates in Louisiana through this type of arrangement. Louisiana’s solar tax credits cover up to 50% of the first $25,000 spent for installation, in addition to the 30% federal tax credit. Companies and individuals in our area have already realized significant benefits from this favorable tax environment, with East Baton Route Parish ranking fourth among Louisiana’s 64 parishes in total number of net solar installations. 
In addition to the CATS bus fleet, we also propose converting the entire  CATS fleet to electric vehicles. 
For optimized routes carrying only 1-3 passengers, smaller, less-expensive electric fleet vehicles such as 
Nissan Leafs or Chevrolet Volts could carry out the pick-ups. We are hopeful that moving to an all-elec -
tric public transportation system will help open the minds of Baton Rouge residents to the advantages of electric vehicles for their own personal use. With many popular destinations in Baton Rouge spread out across longer distances, range anxiety is a real fear for many people. For this reason, exposing our commu -
nity to electric vehicles in as many ways as possible will be a critical component to shifting mindsets and incentivizing people in our community to purchase, rent or share electric vehicles. Today, there are a handful of electric vehicle charging stations in our community. However, as detailed previously, additional electric charging stations are coming to the City-Parish soon. A number of vendors, including Telefonix, have ex -
pressed interest in partnering with the City-Parish and private-sector companies to expand electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
Finally, with support from organizations like Argnonne National Lab, we intend to explore the application 
of smart grid infrastructure in Baton Rouge. To support widespread electric vehicle acceptance, we recog -
nize the importance of proper smart grid infrastructure planning and standards. 
Phase 3 (Vision Elements 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 11)
As the City-Parish embraces smart infrastructure and electric vehicle infrastructure, the entire community will need to adapt to fit into the changing transportation environment. Research has demonstrated that people are not yet ready to embrace autonomous vehicles due to concerns with safety and an inability to trust the technology. 
To demonstrate a first-mover commitment, all City-Parish vehicles will be converted to autonomous, electric 
vehicles over time during Phase 3. In so doing, residents will become accustomed to seeing first responders travel around the city without human drivers at the helm. The benefits of having law enforcement, firefight -
ers, and emergency medical service technicians in autonomous vehicles will be easily understood as they are able to focus on the safety of our community, rather than the traffic in their path. Transit and other shared-CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE25
use vehicles will be converted to autonomous vehicles incrementally as riders learn to trust the technology 
through their first-hand experiences. And, as transit performance improves to meet residents’ needs, more and more people will turn to public transit for their transportation needs. 
For those residents choosing to maintain a personal vehicle, incentives can be put in place so that the vehi -
cle conforms to changing infrastructure. Just as the State has incentivized the purchase of alternative fuel 
vehicles, autonomous vehicle purchases can be incentivized with state tax credits. Or, perhaps technology developed within the Transportation Technology Innovation Center can be introduced into existing ve -
hicles to convert them to fully autonomous transportation options. Furthermore, pilot zones where only electric, autonomous vehicles are allowed to enter will inevitably force users to convert their personal vehicle. The freight industry will also be required to adapt our technologies into their travel modes. Large freight trucks will become autonomous vehicles communicating with signals and other vehicles to traverse roads deemed safe for their travel, and multimodal facilities like ports and railway hubs will become safer, more efficient spaces for the movement of large or hazardous cargo.  Finally, the availability of on-demand shared ride services like Uber will reach new highs, as the only limitation will be the availability of vehicles, not the availability of drivers.
The benefits of autonomous cars are numerous, but there are security concerns that must be addressed. An 
autonomous car and traffic sensing system provides multiple components that can be hacked, including GPS, LiDAR, cameras, detailed digital maps, and other instrumentation. For example, autonomous cars will interrogate and reserve an intersection within seconds of approaching it, a transaction that could be hacked and compromised. A variety of attacks could be perpetrated including denial, spoofing, physical at -
tacks (for example, causing a truck carrying hazardous materials to crash in a location where many residents are vulnerable to the effects of a spill), and attempts to induce situations that overload systems (including temporary stop signs and moving or stationary obstacles). 
To address concerns about privacy and cybersecurity, we will work with companies like IEM, an interna -
tional homeland security company with experience in Intelligent Transportation Systems and cyber security 
that has maintained a Baton Rouge office for over 30 years. Specifically, we will work with IEM, IBM and others to reduce opportunities for system breaches by limiting cellular network use to centralized moni -
toring, using a one-way communication channel and ensuring the DSRC network has strong access con -
trols; designing, developing and testing software with the security mindset, including incorporating strong vulnerability and cyber-attack detection capabilities; assessing the security benefits of passive vision-based technology vs. LiDAR; and retaining fail-safe systems that enable manual control in the event of an attack.
Given its current status as a destination for hurricane evacuees and its growing vulnerability to extreme 
weather events, Baton Rouge is also an excellent place to consider another aspect of a fully autonomous vehicle future. In a future with potentially no vehicle ownership, protocols will be necessary to handle emer -
gency evacuations. As a cutting edge homeland security organization, IEM will assist the City-Parish in designing, testing, and implementing the right protocols for emergency evacuations during implementation of the Smart City Challenge.
Phase 4 (Vision Elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 11)
Ultimately, our city will evolve well beyond traditional traffic signals. With increased adoption of auton -
omous, electric vehicles, all intersections will be optimized so that autonomous vehicles move seamlessly through. Existing traffic signal infrastructure will be repurposed to convert antiquated lights into data hubs, directing traffic seamlessly and simultaneously from all entering streets. As a vehicle approaches an intersection, in essence, it will reserve the right to pass along a pre-determined route ensuring that it avoids any oncoming traffic. CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE26
Most important to this final implementation will be the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists. Through in -
novative apps or some yet to be determined technology, multi-modal residents wishing to cross through 
intersections will also have to reserve their route upon approach. Cars will be directed away from passing pedestrians to ensure ample space and safety is maintained. 
Desired Outcomes
Measuring the impact of these transformational changes will be critical to successful implementation. Each of the indicators outlined below will help determine how effective our solutions are at increasing access to public transportation, increasing active transit options, minimizing our environmental impact, and improving public health in our community.

fied in the next phase of the application in conjunction with budgeting and detailed phasing.CITY OF BATON ROUGE, PARISH OF EAST BATON ROUGE27
Conclusion
In order to effectively execute this proposal, the City-Parish will establish a dedicated program office 
known as the Office of Digital Innovation, housed within the Mayor’s Office. This organizational struc-ture has already been designed and, as such, represents an opportunity for immediately making this Smart City initiative its flagship initiative. This office will be led by a Chief Data Officer (CDO), who will ensure the successful integration of all data-related elements of this effort and work in conjunction with the Department of Information Services to deploy and manage related technologies and solutions. In addition, this CDO will manage complex relationships among our partners, while continuously eval -
uating our implementation. Also housed within this office will be a Deputy Director for Digital Engage -
ment who will be a dedicated resource for ensuring effective collaboration among all community stake -
holders and partners, while continuously evaluating our implementation. While these staff will report directly to our Mayor-President, the office will be an agile operation that can and should move nimbly across City-Parish agencies and our community to effectively deliver the services and solutions we pro -
pose. The leadership of this office will be guided by a community-based Smart City Steering Committee, represented by key partner organizations and responsible for providing insights, counsel, and connectivity to ensure sustained implementation of this effort.
Baton Rouge will become a Smart City of the future. Our community will embrace technologies and 
innovations that to many are unimaginable today. We will transform how people move from A to B by leapfrogging our current transportation infrastructure to the infrastructure of the future. Intersections will be safer and all users of our system will have full, unimpeded access to our new transportation net -
work. Ultimately, we will embrace mobility that is efficient, safe, affordable, and sustainable. We will become a pilot for communities across the country who struggle like we do with congestion. Fueled by strong, proven partnerships, we will show how true collaboration leads to fundamentally new approaches to old problems and truly become a community with no traffic signals.

BEYOND TRAFFIC: THE SMART CITY CHALLENGEAPPLICATION
PART 11
VISION
City growth will continue to aggravate the 
already existing problems of congestion, pollution, infrastructure optimization, limited resources, and sea level rise and flood conditions arising from climate warming. Industry, cities, and authorities need new and innovative solutions to meet these threats. Miami and its partners propose to meet this challenge through smart technologies, providing new management tools for its leaders to increase predictability and economic prosperity, enhance the quality of life, improve road user safety and experience, and move toward a sustainable future.
The Smart Project being proposed by 
Miami, hereafter referred to as Smart Miami Project, will use innovative solutions that can be joined together with a portfolio of partnerships including the leading best-in-class companies and local institutions to provide smart urban mobility technologies that are efficient, cost-effective, scalable, replicable, intuitive, and transformational. 
Pooling existing technology from partner 
agencies and a development of improved technology the Smart Miami Project will develop a central data repository to provide a fabric of shareable compatible data that will create opportunities for innovation in predictive planning that will inform decision making, enhance knowledge of assets, improve safety and mobility, and reduce congestion leading to a more vibrant community. The Smart Miami Project will serve as a role model for other cities in the US to learn from and copy, facilitating a rise of Smart Cities across the country. 
CITY’S CHALLENGES
Miami is not alone in some of the transportation-related challenges it faces over the coming decade, including an aging population, travel demand that stresses and exceeds peak period capacity, and projections for continued significant growth in both population and employment. At the same time, Miami must also address other challenges that, if not unique, are especially emphasized by its particular combination of geographic, cultural, demographic, and environmental characteristics as well as its transportation context within Florida and the US. More specifically:
•
 M
iami is limited by its geographic 
surroundings, including an ocean 
and the Everglades; these constraints prevent further outward expansion and require vertical growth that will inevitably increase urban density. 
•
 T
he near and mid-term effects 
of climate change have profound implications for future growth and development. Porous land and limited elevation represent just two challenges to the necessary mitigation that the City will have to undertake to ensure its long-term sustainability.
•
 D
ecision making for infrastructure 
improvements is made complex by the multi-jurisdictional nature of the City’s transportation grid, where at least eight distinct entities have varying degrees of oversight over the City’s transportation infrastructure.
•
 T
wo ongoing efforts to reintroduce 
intercity rail service with termini in downtown Miami, including an intercity rail line to Orlando and a second commuter rail to Palm Beach County, will require special coordination and integration with the many other available travel modes and within the context of the challenges already noted.2

TECHNOLOGY ELEMENTS
 
Urban Automation•
 T
o more efficiently deliver city services to the public and the commercial sector 
through better automation of the delivery of those services drawing on a wider 
array of public and private data sources. 
•
 T
o enable better automation within the commercial sector through making 
available in machine readable format real time information on the city’s infrastructure.
 
Connected 
Vehicles•
 T
o develop and integrate the use of cell phone based and commercial truck 
and transit Automated Vehicle Location (AVL) connected vehicle applications with the existing road and smart grid sensor technology in the project area. 
 
Intelligent, 
Sensor-Based 
Infrastructure•
 T
o integrate in a common publicly accessible database the existing road 
sensor technologies on the freeways, the signalized arterials, and the current AVL technology used by transit operators. 
• To augment the use of AVL by PortMiami to enhance efficiency, security, and 
reliability of critical freight movements. 
•
 T
o extend real-time monitoring capabilities through the use of connected 
vehicles supplemented with additional road sensors connected to central control center(s).
INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO URBAN TRANSPORTATION
 
User-Focused 
Mobility Services & 
Choices•
 T
o enhance both the availability of public transit and shared transportation 
services within the project site and the public’s knowledge of those services. 
• To increase mobility services and choices (and the knowledge of those 
services) available to senior citizens, the disabled and the unemployed within the project area. 
•
 T
o leverage technology to provide affordable and accessibility trip planning 
and transportation options for all users.
 
Urban Analytics•
 T
o aggregate and supplement existing data sources and tools from public 
and private partners to create an open, machine and human accessible data repository with supporting analytical tools. 
• 
 T
o integrate the Miami-Dade MPO Transportation Planning tools already 
available to the public with the new central database(s). 
•
 T
o extend the MPO planning tools to also address the needs of the utilities 
and the commercial sector for predicting future demand.
 
Urban Delivery & 
Logistics•
 T
o expedite and lower the cost of providing urban delivery and logistics 
through the sharing of real-time information on transportation infrastructure status, through coordination with PortMiami and the Miami International Airport, and through improved real-time control of the infrastructure.CITY OF MIAMI

CITY OF MIAMI 
BEYOND TRAFFIC: THE SMART CITY CHALLENGEAPPLICATION
PART 1
CITY POPULATION  
(BASED ON 2010  
DECENNIAL CENSUS)
The City of Miami, known as the “Gateway 
to the Americas”, is a 35.87 square miles compact microcosm of economic, social, and ethnic diversity. The 2010 census data depicts that a majority of its residents come from minority backgrounds, with 70% Hispanic/Latino and 19.2% Black. 
Prior to 2000, the Southeast Florida 
area consisted of three urbanized areas designated by the Census Bureau. Each designated urbanized area contained a central city and development at urban density levels surrounding that city within the respective boundaries for Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. By the time of the 2000 census and because of unique topographic constraints, development had occurred to a level that began to blur the county lines; this resulted in the U.S. Census Bureau designating a single urbanized area for all of Southeast Florida. The resulting single urbanized area is generally linear, quite narrow in the east-west direction and very long in the north-south direction. Despite this designation, the central cities continue to increase in population and density and their relationships with their respective surrounding local urban areas remain largely as they were prior to the re-designation. Thus, each of the previous three urbanized areas continue to function with a great deal of independence. In the spirit of this NOFO’s expressed interest in the local urban area population, therefore, this Application recognizes the local urban area to be equivalent to Miami Dade County, which is the functional local urban area surrounding Miami and which was also the boundary of the officially designated urbanized area prior to 2000.The 2010 Census reflects a Miami population of 399,443 people with 11,136 persons per square mile. This represents 16% of the local urban area population, which was approaching 2,500,000 in the 2010 Census.
In 2010, Miami had 183,994 housing units, 
a $30,375 median household income (US Census). Downtown Miami is the City’s central business district which has nearly 200 main offices and US branches of multinationals, a 222,000 daytime population, 81,000 residents and an average household income of $95,928. There is 19 million square feet of Class A and B office space and 2.5 million square feet of retail space as well as the sea port, large sporting facilities, and museums.

ATTRIBUTE CHARACTERISTICS OF MIAMI
Public 
TransportationAccording to the 2013 APTA Fact Book, the Miami Urbanized Area is the ninth ranked urbanized area of the US in terms of unlinked annual passenger trips (160 million). Public transportation in Miami is operated by Miami-Dade Transit and the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority (SFRTA). It includes commuter rail (TriRail), heavy-rail rapid transit (MetroRail), an elevated people mover (MetroMover), a Trolley System, and buses (MetroBus). Miami has Florida’s highest transit ridership, 17% of residents using transit on a daily basis. The Miami Intermodal Center and Miami Central Station, near the airport, serve MetroRail, Amtrak, TriRail, MetroBus, Greyhound Lines, taxis, rental cars, MIA Mover, private automobiles, bicycles and pedestrians.
Conducive Environment for DemonstrationMiami is the 44th most populous city located in the 8th most populous urbanized area of the US. Downtown Miami is a major center for international banks, many large national companies, hospitals, research institutes and biotechnology companies. The PortMiami is the number one cruise passenger port in the world (home to 5 cruise lines) and one of the largest ports in the US, importing 8 million tons of cargo a year. Miami is home to two universities that collectively enroll 70,000 students . The Miami International Airport is first in the country in terms of international freight, second in international passengers and third in total cargo .
Continuity of Leadership and CapacityMiami employs the Mayor-Commissioner system of government. Five commissioners are elected from their individual districts. The mayor is elected at large. Mayor Regalado was first elected in 2009. He was a city commissioner for 13 years before becoming mayor. The City Manager, Daniel J. Alfonso, worked 17 years with Miami-Dade County before coming to the City of Miami in 2011. The City employs over 4,000 employees. The adopted 2015-2016 operating budget of $942 million includes $2.2 million for technology. The 2015-2016 Capital budget is $607 million. 
Commitment to Sharing EconomyMiami currently hosts several car sharing operators: Miami car2go, Zipcar, Enterprise CarShare among others. In 2014, the LAB Miami, a campus for social and tech innovation located in Miami, hosted a sharing economy conference with a Miami-Dade commissioner and representatives from the private sector sharing economy. Miami’s CitiBike sharing service has been operating since 2011. It has a fleet of 1,500 bicycles available at 150 stations. Uber and Lyft have been operating in Miami since 2014 and serve the airport. Miami-Dade County is working on updating its regulatory framework for Uber and Lyft type services. 
Commitment to Open Accessible DataThe City currently operates a website for linking residents to government services. The NET provides quick links for permits, applications, services, resources, and reporting  problems online and publicizes planning/zoning permits and waivers, tax preparation assistance, and hearing board processes. It also has a Department of Communications whose sole mission is to facilitate communication with the City’s residents. 
The City currently provides several “e-services” through its public website to support 
businesses. These e-services include: iBuildMiami Land Management, Building Online Access, City Address Check, Code Violation Search, GIS Zoning and Solicitations on line. The City and the County are moving to develop open data policies that further expand data access and connect citizens with city departments.8
CITY OF MIAMI 
BEYOND TRAFFIC: THE SMART CITY CHALLENGEAPPLICATION
PART 1
POPULATION (200,000 – 850,000)
The City’s 2010 Census population was 399,433, which is well within the USDOT target range.
URBAN POPULATION DENSITY
The urban population density is calculated to be 11,136 per square mile. This density will almost certainly increase in the future because Miami must grow vertically as it continues to increase its population and employment base.
REPRESENTATION OF THE LOCAL URBAN 
AREA (> 15%)The method used by USDOT to compute the percentage that the City’s population represents of the local urban area is flawed in how it was applied to Maimi, due to the unique nature and growth characteristics of the South Florida area. The result was that USDOT concluded Miami’s population does not represent greater than 15% of the local urban area when in fact it does – Miami’s population actually represents 16% of the local urban area population. The following paragraphs explain why this is the case.
Prior to 2000, the Southeast Florida 
area consisted of three urbanized areas designated by the Census Bureau. Each designated urbanized area contained a central city and development at urban density levels surrounding that city within the county boundaries for Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. By the 2000 census, narrow linear development trends caused by the unique geography of the area (i.e., the ocean to the east and the Everglades to the west) were beginning to blur the county lines. This resulted in the designation of a single urbanized area for all of Southeast Florida, but which in reality is split between three different MPOs (Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade) and two FDOT districts.The central cities in each of the three initially separate urbanized areas continue to increase in population and density and the relationships between the respective urban cores and their surrounding local urban areas remain as they were prior to 2000. Thus, each of the previously-designated three urbanized areas continue to function with a great deal of independence.
For these reasons, the “local urban area”, 
which is the language specifically used in USDOT’s NOFO, should be considered to be the area consisting of Miami-Dade County and exclusive of both Broward and Palm Beach counties. Thus when the actual development, operating, and travel patterns are seen in this truer light, it becomes clear that Miami’s population represents 16% of the surrounding local urban area population.

USER-FOCUSED MOBILITY 
SERVICES AND CHOICES
Smart city transportation is about offering 
choices that range from individual vehicles, to shared transportation services, ubiquitous transit connectivity, and a full range of multimodal transportation options. Miami’s vision emphasizes an increasing detachment from the former, single-occupancy vehicle use, and emphasizes the latter choices. With its online trolley tracking system, availability of shared-use transportation services, shared water taxis, and high-occupancy vehicle lanes on the city’s freeway network, Miami offers the foundation for this vision. The focus of this application is to significantly expand transportation options throughout the city and assure that the full spectrum of services is available to all users. 16

Urban analytics is what makes a knowledgeable city into a smart city. Miami and Miami-Dade County already have over a decade of experience with many features of a smart city already in place and functioning in the real world. 
SUMMARY OF APPROACH AND 
PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONSMiami will build on the extensive commercial and public databases and analytical platforms already in place in Miami-Dade County, integrating and CITY OF MIAMI 
BEYOND TRAFFIC: THE SMART CITY CHALLENGEAPPLICATION
PART 117augmenting them to create a truly smart 
and accessible database with supporting analytical platforms for commercial, private, and public users.
Miami-Dade has several key components 
of a future central database already in place. These include FDOT’s TMC and real-time databases that feeds the 511 Travel Information System, and RSS and Twitter feeds capabilities. 
In addition, Miami-Dade currently has 
several analytical platforms and databases already in place. Most of these analytical platforms and tools are currently housed at the Miami-Dade Metropolitan Planning Organization, but the Florida International University also houses a significant analytical resource in its ITS laboratory. Miami will develop a distributed urban analytics database wrapped with analysis tools to assemble the databases and tools already available in the area, interface them with other available commercial databases and tools (e.g. INRIX, HERE, ESRI, GOOGLE, etc.), and augment them to fill the utilities, public safety, public health and other identified gaps. The analytical tools “wrap” the distributed central database so that the user need not worry about exactly where a particular data item comes from.
SYNERGISTIC ELEMENTS FOR 
MEASURABLE, COST-EFFECTIVE IMPACT IN DEPLOYMENT & OPERATIONThe synergistic elements of this approach result from the mutually-beneficial effects of the extensive commercial and public sector investments in databases and tools; the existing 511 travel information system; the Southeast Regional Planning Model; FIU’s ITS Laboratory; the INRIX, HERE, ESRI, and GOOGLE resources (among others); bicycle and car sharing services; and ongoing public and private sector database maintenance annual outlays. The approach does not require public or private sector entities to change how they develop and operate their current databases and tools. It also hides the complexities of the various databases behind “wrapper” software.
URBAN DELIVERY AND LOGISTICS
The Smart Miami Project will enhance urban delivery and logistics through the sharing of real-time information on transportation infrastructure status, coordination with the PortMiami and the Miami International Airport, and improved real-time control of the infrastructure.
PortMiami, managed by the Miami-Dade 
County Seaport Department, is located just outside of Downtown Miami on a 520 acre island. Port Tunnel opened in August 2014 providing direct access to the Interstate System. Rail service was restored to the port earlier in 2014 and an on-port intermodal container transfer facility (ICTF) is under construction. A deep dredge is also underway that will allow for the main channel to accommodate post-Panamax ships. 
Miami International Airport (MIA) is just 
eight miles outside of downtown Miami; it is the gateway to Latin America and the Caribbean and handles over 80 percent of cargo movements from these markets. It is expected to experience an average annual growth of 3.5 percent. 
There are currently four foreign trade zones 
(FTZ’s) in Miami-Dade County. FTZ 281 is the newest foreign trade zone designated in Miami-Dade County, extending from SW 8th Street in the south to the county border with Broward in the north. FTZ 281 will be among the first to be operated under the Alternative Site Framework’s (ASF) streamlined process.18

STRATEGIC BUSINESS MODELS 
AND PARTNERING
The Smart Miami Project relies on 
developing and sustaining strategic partnering opportunities between public agencies and the private sector to build on the individual efforts, assets, and capabilities of its partner agencies as well as the local universities (i.e., Florida International University’s ITS Laboratory), the commercial shared ride sector’s CITY OF MIAMI 
BEYOND TRAFFIC: THE SMART CITY CHALLENGEAPPLICATION
PART 119activities (i.e., Uber and Lyft), state of the 
practice software developers and smart city managed service providers (i.e., Code For Miami, IBM, and Serco), smart city product vendors (i.e., Cisco, Verizon, Ericsson, and AT&T), and commercial data aggregators (i.e., Google, INIRX, and ESRI) to generate improved real time data information that is sharable and open for all.
SUMMARY OF APPROACH AND 
PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONSMiami will assemble, oversee and facilitate this assembly of talent, capability and assets to implement the specific vision elements identified in Table 1  and 
described in the high-level overview herein. Technology solutions will focus on proven technologies that are already successfully deployed, using assets that either exist or are already planned for implementation and operation.
SYNERGISTIC ELEMENTS FOR 
MEASURABLE, COST-EFFECTIVE IMPACT IN DEPLOYMENT & OPERATIONThe availability of real time data information will result in additional benefits that go well beyond those already identified. As an example, Cisco recently launched a citywide WiFi service as a component of the CIM. Citywide WiFi is convenient for citizens who want to connect to the Internet, but it has been found to provide substantial value beyond that. These WiFi services now enable connected services like automated parking management in which sensors and mobile apps help direct drivers to open parking spaces or improved public safety with IP-enabled video surveillance.
The availability of these connected 
services bring in tremendous benefits. For example, better parking management helps reduce traffic congestion in business districts, citizens spend less time searching for parking spots, CO2 emissions are reduced, and the City is able to improve collections from parking violators. In this case, the network provides the foundation for innovative city services, with anytime, anywhere Internet access for residents, better citywide data collection, and support of local businesses.
SMART GRID, ROADWAY 
ELECTRIFICATION AND EV’S
This element of the Smart Miami Project 
includes strategies and initiatives that leverage the smart grid – a programmable and efficient energy transmission and distribution system – in an effort to support the adoption or expansion of roadway electrification, and electric vehicle deployment. The project will bring utility delivery systems into the 21st century with computer based remote control and automation. The systems would include two-way communication technology, the augmentation of EV recharge stations in downtown garages and the dissemination to the public of information on their availability in real time.
Florida Power & Light (FPL) currently has 
plans to connect nearly 500,000 street lights which will represent one of the largest, if not the largest, networked street light program in the world. The multi-application network platform that is the foundation of the Smart Miami Project will be the backbone of an interconnected smart grid and smart city through proven, standards-based solutions that are secure, flexible and reliable.20
CITY OF MIAMI 
BEYOND TRAFFIC: THE SMART CITY CHALLENGEAPPLICATION
PART 1SUMMARY OF APPROACH AND 
PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONSThe Smart Miami Project approach is to expand and promote assets already in place within the Challenge Area (such as, for example, EV recharge stations in downtown parking garages); and also to integrate related initiatives already being planned (for example, FPL’s plan to connect and network nearly 500,000 street lights) into the multi-application network platform.
SYNERGISTIC ELEMENTS FOR 
MEASURABLE, COST-EFFECTIVE IMPACT IN DEPLOYMENT & OPERATIONThe smart grid, electrification and EV’s within Miami’s Challenge Area will integrate and enhance the other components of the Smart Miami Project within the framework of the vision elements identified in Table 1 . 
The smart grid system being planned by FPL is a model for the country as evidenced in the recent visit and associated remarks made about this planned project by Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz.
CONNECTED, INVOLVED CITIZENS
This vision element consists of strategies, local campaigns, and processes to proactively engage and inform citizens at the individual level by deploying hardware, software, and open data platforms in an effort to increase personal mobility. This element will leverage the use of crowd source data to achieve its objectives. Our vision for the Smart City Miami emphasizes full connectivity and integration of transportation and city services. We firmly believe that this full connectivity can only be achieved with the full support of connected, involved citizens. Our citizens, as well as our many annual visitors, play an integral part in our vision. Only if our citizens embrace and promote the vision, will we be able to maximize its chance for success.
With the help of connected citizens and 
crowd-sourcing technologies, the City will be enabled to solicit opinions, sources, and surveys. Online platforms and open-source GIS serve as technology solutions that can connect citizens with city departments. By connecting with citizens, we will be able to find out what they would like to see in their communities, and may also keep them informed by streaming video of public meetings or publishing information to an online portal. 
SUMMARY OF APPROACH AND 
PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONSThrough use of technology and an inclusive public outreach and involvement process, Miami will include its citizens in forming, promoting, and implementing the Smart Miami vision. Key features of Miami’s efforts for connected, involved citizens include:
•
 U
se of digital decision-making tools 
that facilitate the inclusion of multiple 
stakeholders, including the public. 
•
 E
nhanced availability of open data and 
GIS (geographic information systems) to provide constituents with access to government information that is technically easy to retrieve, process and use, without a formal request process. 
• 
 I
mplement crowd sourcing platforms 
to solicit needed opinions or services from online social media networks or communities of citizens. 
•
 L
everage crowd funding to tap the 
financial power of individual donors, and give them opportunities to donate small amounts of money to fund public works projects.
•
 S

PART 121social media platforms help citizens stay 
informed about issues of interest and enable them to interact with each other, elected officials and municipal leaders.
SYNERGISTIC ELEMENTS FOR MEASURABLE, COST-EFFECTIVE IMPACT IN DEPLOYMENT & OPERATIONThe synergistic elements of this approach include the following:
Smart Miami Project will leverage the 
City’s existing public outreach systems, and expand them to provide broader accesses to all citizens. Through the use of technology, the City will build new ways for citizens to get connected with City departments, share data with residents, and provide ways for them to support the City with data. With more robust access to feedback the City will:
•
 C
ommit to getting better results for 
residents by using data and evidence,
•
 M

along the way,
•
 A
ct on data and evidence for all major 
decisions, and 
•
 T
ake stock to measure progress, 
learn, and make corrections and 
improvements.
DATA, ARCHITECTURE AND 
STANDARDS
This vision element emphasizes 
interoperable regional architectures, employing the National ITS Architecture and Connected Vehicle Reference Implementation Architecture (CVRIA), among others to achieve uniform operation that is accessible to everyone for safe and efficient transportation operations. As part of this effort, the nature of required interfaces to other City and County systems will be defined utilizing existing networking or other standards when available. Where new standards are needed, these needs will be fully documented. Further, these interfaces will be documented using the CVRIA system architecture tools with feedback provided to the USDOT to facilitate expansion of CVRIA to accommodate these additional interfaces. The demonstration site will use existing ITS standards, architectures, and certification processes for ITS and connected vehicle based technologies (where feasible) so as to support nationwide deployment of ITS infrastructure and connected vehicle technologies. Exceptions, when needed, will be documented.
SUMMARY OF APPROACH AND 
PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONSThe City of Miami’s Smart City vision for data and architecture is to have a single platform hosted by Miami-Dade County that is accessible to all city departments, emergency departments, and system operations within the County. This system will build on the County’s current Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS), which is a state-of-the-art, distributed traffic signal monitor and control system managing over 2,000 intersections. It will integrate the current traffic signal operations system with future technologies including: transit, on- and off-street parking sensors, traffic count devices for all modes, and climate-related sensors.
The architecture developed as part of this 
effort will follow the CVRIA/National ITS Architecture. Each architecture data flow will be mapped to ITS standards which will establish the protocol for how devices operate and data exchanges occur.22

BEYOND TRAFFIC: THE SMART CITY CHALLENGEAPPLICATION
PART 1SYNERGISTIC ELEMENTS FOR 
MEASURABLE, COST-EFFECTIVE IMPACT IN DEPLOYMENT & OPERATIONThe Miami Project will result in a cost effective modular architecture, building on existing and developing standards, architectures, and processes for ITS and connected vehicles and other services that can flexibly incorporate new partners and services as the smart city evolves.
LOW-COST, EFFICIENT, SECURE, 
AND RESILIENT ICT
The vision element includes determining the 
extent to which systems will collect or store Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and PII-related information, and ensure that there is a legitimate need for this information to meet the goals of the system. The system will further guarantee that the data is only accessible for, and used for, the legitimate purposes of the Smart City vision.
This element further includes working 
with the USDOT developed prototype security credential management system (SCMS), which will be available for use in DSRC-based communications. The SCMS will provide digitally signed certificates that can be used to ensure trusted DSRC communications between connected vehicle devices, roadside devices and the SCMS. The SCMS will be supplemented with physical security of deployed devices and security for non DSRC communications. Industry best practices will be used.
As the central technology provider 
for Miami-Dade County, Information Technology Department (ITD) services are designed to improve government access, efficiency, and public value through responsive service, integrated information, and a shared infrastructure that is cost-effective, secure and reliable. Services that the County ITD provides include business intelligence report/dashboard authoring; enterprise content management (ECM) oversight and operations; enterprise asset management system (EAMS) oversight and operations; enterprise resource planning; and enterprise sustainability for countywide sustainability efforts (i.e., a countywide utility bill management solution). 
SUMMARY OF APPROACH AND 
PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONSThe Smart Miami team will work closely with ITD to ensure the privacy protection of personal identifiable information as well as the security protection of each management system associated with the multi-application network platform that is the foundation of the Smart Miami Project.
The City will also work closely and 
collaboratively with its partners, and particularly its hardware and product providers, to develop and implement measures for assuring the physical security of deployed devices. This will include but not be limited to electronic monitoring and tamper-detection systems.
SYNERGISTIC ELEMENTS FOR 
MEASURABLE, COST-EFFECTIVE IMPACT IN DEPLOYMENT & OPERATIONIn 2013 the Public Technology Institute’s Annual Solutions Awards Competition recognized Miami-Dade County’s Private Cloud implementation, where County data are stored and accessed from anywhere at any time, securely. As a result of this implementation, the ITD’s Private Cloud infrastructure has saved the County over $2 million in capital and related licensing costs in physical server replacements; this is one example of the types of synergistic outcomes that can be expected to emanate from the Smart Miami Project.CITY OF MIAMI

SMART LAND USE
The Smart Miami Project will expand on the 
success of the City’s current neighborhood based planning process to promote smart land uses that promote sustainability, livability, accessibility, and reliability. In concert with Miami’s mixed-used zoning ordinance, the net effects of the Smart Miami are expected to concentrate growth in the compact walkable urban center and promote intensification of transit-oriented, walkable, bicycle-friendly land uses.
Miami is significantly advantaged by its 
mixed-use zoning ordinance and particularly Miami 21, which is intended to densify the local urban area. Miami 21 is inherently mixed use; allowing a range of residential, commercial, office, and institutional uses in many of its zoning categories. This has created a dynamic land development climate that is fluid and highly responsive to changing conditions. Miami’s public and private realms are strategically poised to take advantage of Smart City investments.  
SUMMARY OF APPROACH AND 
PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONSMiami’s approach to incorporating smart land use into the Smart Miami Project is one of fully utilizing the strength and adaptability that already exists in its current zoning ordinance, which foresee and allow the kind of mixed land use changes that are expected to follow the deployment, operation and management of the integrated smart city components that make up the Smart Miami Project. Miami 21 has encouraged the densification of Miami’s central business district and greater downtown area. Miami has also found a data aggregation partner in Gridics, which has developed an application that provides access to a range of data from a variety of sources. The Gridics team has relied on the City as the authoritative source for much of this data, and in exchange the City has been provided early access to this platform. Gridics allows high level zoning and land use analysis to be conducted on a single platform, bringing in data from multiple sources. Adding Smart City mechanisms listed in previous sections to Gridics’ layers of data will allow City planning and zoning staff to conduct high-level analysis through the lens of the transportation-land use connection.
SYNERGISTIC ELEMENTS FOR 
MEASURABLE, COST-EFFECTIVE IMPACT IN DEPLOYMENT & OPERATIONMiami 21 has encouraged the densification of Miami’s central business district and greater downtown area. Providing for a mix of uses allows neighborhood servicing commercial and office uses to open as the market demands, and in close proximity to existing and emerging population centers. The City’s commercial corridors have been rebuilt to function as Mixed-Use, transit-oriented, walkable centers for adjacent residential neighborhoods. 
The multi-application network platform 
that is the foundation of the Smart Miami Project will open the door to business and employment activities in the Project Area that can leverage the available sharable data and technologies, and who can benefit from reduced congestion, increased reliability, and enhanced accessibility and cost-effectiveness of the transportation system serving the Project Area. The benefits that will come through last-mile freight deliveries is just one example of how the Smart Miami Project can significantly and constructively affect land use characteristics in the Project Area.24

PART 1RISK ASSESSMENT 
The City proposes integration of risk 
management into the strategic and decision-making processes organization wide. A risk sensitive approach will be utilized to avoid potential failures. When feasible and beneficial, policy will be integrated into the municipal code and pertinent regulations.
The most significant technical risk 
anticipated by the Project Team is the team’s ability to seamlessly integrate disparate databases into a single multi-application network platform; the risk of failure here is considered to be minimal. The most significant policy risk is that conflicting policies among partners may impede the effective flow of critical information; the risk of failure here is low. The most significant institutional risk is in the continued stability of the partnership agencies and their staff; the risk of failure here is considered to be minimal.
Internal and external risks will be 
considered holistically. They will be managed as a system, while considering the underlying factors that directly impact organizational effectiveness and mission success. Leadership will commit to employing a consistent approach across the organization, actively participate, and support risk management practices and incorporate risk information into their decision making. Information will cascade up to provide leadership with an organization-wide view of the risks to promote better tradeoff decisions and enhance application of foresight.

COLLABORATION & 
PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT 
ANTICIPATED OPPORTUNITIES FOR COLLABORATION
The City will work closely with its Partners, 
outside consultants and subject matter experts as well as USDOT representatives to ensure that the multi-application platform it develops for assimilating and disseminating data from street-level operations and sensors is open and sharable.
The City intends for the multi-application 
platform developed in this project to be modular so that it is scalable to different applications. The platform will also be devoid of proprietary software and non-standard architecture so that it is easily transferable and adoptable by other mid-size cities. In this regard, the Partnership will regularly and actively publicize its work and progress, while inviting comments and soliciting suggestions at all times from the transportation community at large. 
ANTICIPATED DOCUMENTATION 
CONTRIBUTIONS
Documentation of the Smart Miami Project 
will be comprehensive in two respects. First, the multi-application platform developed, deployed, and operated as part of this Project will be fully documented with respect to its configuration, characteristics, capabilities, and use. Second, the progression of work leading to the ultimate implemented and operating products will be chronicled, including but not limited to alternatives considered, successes achieved, lessons learned, and evaluation/assessment outcomes realized. The result will be comprehensive documentation sufficient to facilitate the transfer and use of Project products to other venues and environments and also to guide USDOT and other cities toward best practices and next steps to be undertaken as part of future actions and initiatives.

The City of Miami will track these 
performance measures on a continuous basis for the duration of the project, and will prepare bi-annual status reports summarizing and documenting the progress of our effort in each of the categories. These progress reports will be made available to USDOT, as well as stakeholders and residents within the City of Miami. 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION
City staff will be available to work with 
USDOT on any additional data requests. We recognize the importance of independent evaluation in the Smart City process, and we believe in full transparency in tracking our progress. City staff will work directly with USDOT and provide any requested data pertaining to the Smart Cities project, and assist with additional data collection or data inference requests. This includes providing USDOT or independent evaluators access to the site and site staff in coordination with City staff. We will be available and assist with any surveys, interviews, or evaluation-related experiments requested in this context. CAPACITY FOR PROJECT & 
RESOURCE LEVERAGING 
CAPACITY TO UNDERTAKE THIS PROJECT
The City is a financially attractive and stable 
organization. The City’s General Fund Reserve marked its fourth year of positive growth for the year ended September 30, 2014. 
Miami will manage data collection, evaluate 
trends, track results and align resources to all goals and activities. The City has extensive existing capability to track measurable outcomes at various levels in order to prepare required reporting documents for funding agencies that support the project. All partners will share information regularly with the City. 
RESOURCE LEVERAGING 
OPPORTUNITIES
The City can leverage the considerable 
assets included within internal departments and offices, and with external partners like Miami-Dade County and the Florida Department of Transportation. Partners will also help leverage this project in their respective organizations. The City will also seek to leverage the resources of local educational institutions.

Introduction  
The United States Department of Transportation ( USDOT ) is challenging cities across America to 
innovatively think about and plan its “Smart City” future.  The City of Oceanside has been 
methodically  and independently moving towards its unique Smart City future.  This Funding 
Opportunity will help Oceanside not only achieve its own aggressive Smart City goals, but by 
design, provide a technical and financing roadmap for other cities to follow .  Oceanside has 
developed and implemented a financing model to systematically pay for “smart” infr astructure 
renewal .  Oceanside’s lead investment i s replacing roadway lighting with LEDs, the lowest 
hanging energy savings opportunity for most cities across America , will serve as the backbone 
to enable its Smart City vision .  The vision that Oceanside has embraced is comprehensive, 
integrating emerging Intelligent Transportati on Systems ( ITS) technologies with other city 
services  through a highly secure, common Information and Communications Technology (ICT) 
platform , includ ing water, police, fire, and it’s growing sharing economy  in order to develop its 
holistic connected city v ision . 
Oceanside has taken to heart and fully embraces the USDOT’s stated vision:  
The USDOT’s vision for the Smart City Challenge is to identify an u rbanized area where 
advanced technologies are integrated into the aspects of a city and play a critical role 
in helping cities and their citizens address challenges in safety, mobility, sustainability, 
economic vitality, and address climate change.  
As Ocea nside “pays it forward” we are not just looking to stand up a technical ITS -ICT construct, 
but also create the business financing model that other cities can follow.  We will demonstrate 
a viable mechanism whereby both energy and operational savings will p ay for this “smart 
infrastructure.”  To date, Oceanside’s LED streetlights and metered streetlight power 
distribution system have been paid entirely through a municipal lease , with no out -of-pocket 
monies coming from the City’s General Fund .  We have ident ified several national banks and 
other funding sources that embrace the Oceanside vision of this funding strategy and are 
willing to compete to finance this next phase of ICT and ITS investment .  The next step in 
Oceanside’s financial planning is to establ ish an Enterprise fun d, whereby future cost savings , as 
well as the revenues generated from our planned IC T infrastructure will be captured and 
reinvested in to the expansion of Oceanside’s mobile ICT platform , the Oceanside Municipal 
Network Infrastructure  (OMNI) Mesh Network . 
Oceanside’s Transportation Plan  
Oceanside adopted its General Plan Circulation Element in 2012.  This plan addresses:  
 Enhancing the City’s corridors for all modes of transportation;  
 Increasing bicycle and pedestrian connections, route s and facilities;  
 Refining the City’s traffic calming program to promote safer streets for  motorists, 
pedestrians, and bicyclists;  OCEANSIDE 20/20  
The OMNI -Mesh Network  
Page | 2 
 
 Identifying and incorporating Intelligent Transportation System (ITS)  technology for the 
City;  
 Increasing support of Transpor tation Demand Management programs;  and 
 Improving the efficiency of the existing transportation system.  
A primary goal of the plan calls for “complete streets” enabling compatible and shared use by 
all forms of transportation, including vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians.   A key element of the 
plan describes the City’s vision for enhancing mobility choices through cost -effective 
deployment of Intelligent Transportation  Systems (ITS).  A targeted goal of the City’s ITS system 
is to improve Level Of Service  (LOS), measured in wait times at signaled and un -signaled 
intersections,  across the entire city .   
The City, according to the 2010 census had 167,083 citizens.  As a resort community featuring 
the longest public pier along the West Coast of the United State s, Oceanside can experience a 
peak daily population of nearly 300,000 on busy holiday weekends, with the majority of the 
peak population visiting Oceanside’s nearly five miles of beaches via a mix of transportation 
modes.  Level Of Service is a key metric the City tracks as a key to enhancing the experience of 
living and playing in Oceanside.   
Oceanside’s Transportation is complemented by The Oceanside Transit Center  (OTC) , located in 
the heart of the urban downtown area .  The Transit Center is among the busiest multi -modal 
transportation hub s in San Diego County, annually serving more than 1.2 million commuters , 
connecting San Diego, Orange, Riverside, and Los Angeles Counties .  Operated by the North 
County Transit District  (NTCD) , the center  brings visito rs by rail, light rail and bus, 
complementing service provided by Amtrak and Metrolink rail service.  There is also a mix of 
public parking, both paid and free.  During these peaks, downtown urban density around the 
pier and beaches transforms Oceanside into a highly dense urban city .  The two agencies, 
Oceanside and NCTD, strategically collaborate to assure plan alignment.  
Oceanside’s Intelligent Transportation System (I TS) Plan Elements  
The goals governing Oceanside’s ITS Plan are:  
Goal 1: Encourage and  support the use of Intelligent Transportation  System technologies to 
increase the efficiency of the  transportation network.  
Goal 2: Support the use of ITS technologies as a cost -effective alternative to improve the  
transportation network.  
These goals are achieved through meeting the following objectives:  
1. Improve the safety, security, and movement of goods, people, and  services for all 
modes of transportation by using advanced  technologies, coordinated management 
techniques, and by  providing real -time trave ler information.  
2. Improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions  through traffic signal 
optimization and the use of advanced signal  control techniques.  OCEANSIDE 20/20

3. Ensure compliance with regional ITS architecture and National ITS  standards where 
feasible to pr omote interoperability and  information exchange with other agencies in 
the region.  
4. Work cooperatively with regional ITS and related operations efforts  to enhance regional 
and local response to incidents and events  impacting the City.  
5. Collect data for publi c dissemination a nd/or analysis by the City  traffic engineers.  
Oceanside’s Long Term Plans  
Oceanside’s long term plans are currently governed by the 2030 Regional Transportation Plan 
(RTP), as published by the San Diego Council of Governments ( SANDAG ).  Ad ditional planning 
documents include the 2050 RTP, describes enhanced mobility options desired by 2050 , and  the 
Riding to 205 0, the Regional Bicycle Plan.  
Smart City Development Strategy  – The OMNI -Mesh Network  
Oceanside  fully appreciate s and understand s the strategic transportation focus of the Notice of 
Funding Opportunity ( NOFO .)  With that said, with this proposal, we are taking a strategically 
different approach to our response.  We are proposing a two -pronged approach:   
1. Design, build and demonstrate  the deployment of a citywide mesh -enabled Wi-Fi ICT 
platform, The OMNI -Mesh Network, strategically designed with a cyber security layer 
that is complaint with the most stringent Federal Information Processing Standards 
(FIPS) cyber security levels. This i ssue is important since most technology companies in 
their rush to market overlook the fact that Transportation is a specified segment of 
Critical Infrastructure in the existing 2002 Homeland Security Act legislation which 
triggers with ITS integration.   
2. Design, build and demonstrate the integration of advanced traffic flow monitoring 
sensors as part of the ICT streetlight platform, in the targeted areas (See proposed map 
of designated areas) to continuously and dynamically monitor the flow of traffic.  Th is is 
the foundation layer for enabling advanced ITS capabilities, as well as other city services.  
What is unique with our proposal is that we are proposing to place the mobile 
telecommunications component of our ICT platform atop city -owned streetlights.  Distributed 
and metered power with 2 -way communication every 100 -200 feet across the entire city.  We 
are strategically developing this platform, among other reasons, to minimize or eliminate the 
burgeoning urban clutter of radios and devices now starting  to proliferate atop public 
infrastructure.  And this urban clutter problem will grow unless we take a different approach.  
We have already commenced with this integration through the linking of our metered 
streetlight control system with our ITS system vi a common city -owned fiber optic cabling.  The 
City has a policy of utilizing its fiber optic cable to support as many city functions as practical.  
Why a two -pronged approach?  
The chief reason for our two -pronged approach is simple.  A truly Smart City needs a common 
operating platform to both deploy advanced ITS and non -ITS capabilities , and pay for these OCEANSIDE 20/20  
The OMNI -Mesh Network  
Page | 4 
 
capabilities.  A cyber -secure ICT infrastructure needs to be not just in place, but designed from 
the ground up to be enable many applications  in addition to ITS applications .  It is the 
monetization of these operational and energy efficiency savings that will, over time, pay for the 
build -out of the citywide ICT operational pl atform that will enable emerging ITS and other non -
ITS applications.   
While the general focus is on transportation, the USDOT’s challenge has identified the need to 
integrate the entire city.  With that said, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, including ve hicles, will 
eventually connect to the ICT platform and interact with sensor data .  These devices  will need 
more than just a secure environment.  I n our view of the future, the ICT platform will serve 
both ITS requirements and a host of other city and publ ic services.  Sensor data needs to 
support automation to unlock efficiencies that can be turned into cost savings in every 
connected environment.  Therefore Oceanside is strategically focused on building a highly 
secure ICT operational platform to enable both ITS systems and non -ITS system s. 
Urban Clutter – a Growing Menace  
Urban clutter, or the ad hoc proliferation of devices in public spaces, left unchecked, is fast 
becoming a major municipal policy and planning issue.  In San Diego County alone, we are 
seeing unsightly telecomm equipment being installed  being installed on streetlights in several 
cities where telecomm carriers are attempting to address network traffic weaknesses ahead of 
the new metered streetlight rate about to go into effect.

They ar e staking out their turf as this IoT market heats up.  
Moreover, Southern California Edison (SCE), one of the nation’s 
largest public utilities, is planning to expand their deployment of 
more than 50,000 radios to over 250,000 radios in the next 5 -7 
years and they are targeting streetlights as their prime 
installation location.  SCE is just one of dozens of utilities across 
America planning on installing private radio networks cluttering 
cityscapes as they proceed.  This is currently happening relatively 
unchecked across America.  With this new USDOT push, this 
problem will only be compounded unless a new strategic 
approach, such as proposed here, is implemented.  
Oceanside is tackling this emerging trend head on by designing 
and installing Oceanside’s O MNI-Mesh  Wi-Fi ICT data highway for 
everyone , including the City’s ITS backhaul, cellular carriers, 
utilities, the city itself, as well as for other public and private use.  
Streetlights will have attached devices.  With that said , our integrated strategy is designed to 
minimize clutter by combining backhaul duty for multiple services through one common 
platform.  
Cyber Security Must Be Built into the ICT Platform from  the Beginning  
Again, the 2002 Homeland Security Act stipulates t hat ICT platforms, which ITS systems rely 
upon, must be FIPS -compliant.  Absent this architectural systems design  requirement , ITS 
integration and growth may face  major systemic and legal risk ramifications .  Accelerated ITS 
deployment delivery  across the entire smart city ecosystem  may otherwise  be in jeopardy of 
having to be replaced  with a true FIPS -compliant system .  When infrastructure starts to become 
“smart” and connected, something legal happens – that infrastructure now becomes “critical 
infrastructure ,” which has a special federal definition based on the Homeland Security  Act.  This 
act designates the cybersecurity standard that must be deployed on infrastructure when it is 
designated “critical infrastructure .” This covers transportation systems, energy and smart grid 
systems, IT services and government facilities.   Theref ore, the ICT systems needs to be FIPS -
compliant from the outset because this is the only way to avoid this potential systemic risk .  
Cybersecurity experts use the term: “Security Must Be baked  in from the  Beginning.” As a 
result, we are recommending the US DOT elevate Cyber Security as a technical priority.    
Simply put, i f a FIPS -compliant ICT architecture is not implemented  from the beginning, 
deployed ITC assets will not be properly secure d.  When this happens, the entire ITS and ICT 
platforms will be compromised.  This is a potential systemic risk that the national Internet of 
Things ( IoT) transportation sector appears to be is facing , unless action is taken now.  Expanded 
use of a mobile ICT platform as it relates to integration into an overall Smart City architecture  
further compounds the problem .   This policy issue might be served through formal 
collaboration among the USDOT, Department of Energy , Department of Comme rce, 
Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense to a) agree this is an issue 
Remember the Good 'ol Days?  OCEANSIDE 20/20  
The OMNI -Mesh Network  
Page | 6 
 
that must be addressed from the outset and b) agree to a Cyber Security strategy which help 
cities grow into interconnected smart cities.    
Oceanside’s Core ICT Platform – Smart Streetlights?  
Designing a smart city requires a holistic view of the city as a  living organism, with its roadways 
seen as the lifeblood or arteries connecting  the city.  As Oceanside adds sensors  and grow its 
Smart City organism , what we are really doing is building the neural network connecting all of 
the City’s IoT operations .  Wh en we start adding ITS elements, we are literally adding “limbs 
and fingers .”  Those limbs and fingers need a cyber -secure and robust foundation whose very 
architecture enables automation through machine -to-machine interface.  
As it turns out, s treetlights are uniquely poised to provide the mobile ICT connectivity because:  
1. Streetlights can now provide distributed and metered power everywhere , providing 
energy or food to the city’s new limbs and organs . 
2. Streetlights are spaced 100 -300 feet apart, touching eve ry corner of the city, delivering 
light as a service.  The streetlight typically resides about 30 feet in the air, ideal for 
transmitting and receiving mobile data.  They enable the installation of a mobile data 
operations platform that can handle both est ablished carriers’ small cell data and Wi -Fi 
for public use.  In addition, extending Wi -Fi mesh across the entire city can create a 
potentially significant revenue opportunity by accommodating carrier needs to offload 
data -intensive traffic from existing c ellular networks.  
3. The rights -of-way are already established , accelerating deployment schedules . 
4. Oceanside already own its streetlights, and therefore are direct control s of this 
increasingly valuable asset.  
With the above as a framework, Oceanside is well down the road towards building its vision of a  
smart city .  The city is currently focused on first enabling its ICT operating platform so when ITS 
technologies become commercially viable we will have a natural environment to plug into.  
Oceanside’s forward -leaning investments include : 
1. Conversion of 7,661 streetlights to LED on city -owned streetlights across the entire City 
through an investment  of $3 .8 million.  
2. Installation of the first generation 2-way wireless lighting controls system atop every 
streetlight, incorporating an approved utility -grade meter in each streetlight  through an 
investment of $1.4 million . 
3. Fiber optic cabling across the city to connect existing ITS infrastructure  through an 
investment of  $1.0  million.   
4. Traffic Management Cen ter investment of $1.6 million.  
5. The connection of the City’s streetlight controls system with the City’ s ITS system 
through a common fiber optic backhaul.   This design effort is now underway.  
Distributed Power and Metering – a Breakthrough Moment  
Embarking  on the development of an ICT platform utilizing “smart” streetlights a natural 
evolution, recognizing the real estate value of streetlights installed in publicly -permitted rights -OCEANSIDE 20/20  
The OMNI -Mesh Network  
Page | 7 
 
of-way.  Though the general concept has been around for more than a dozen ye ars, the concept 
was ahead of its time due to technology limitations.  With the proliferation of LEDs atop 
municipal streetlights over the past ten years and the emergence of metered  adaptive 
controlled dimming, the groundwork has been set for this phase o f development.  Specifically, 
“smart meters” now exist within the majority of adaptive controls products from Philips, GE and 
Acuity, among others.  And Oceanside has installed and commissioned 7, 661 meters to date.  
Why is this important?  Because when uti lities accept smart meter data from municipal 
streetlights and are paid for the energy used , the relationship between the utility and the 
municipality changes – for the better.  Cities can now freely utilize metered power delivered to 
streetlights for othe r city services without having to seek special permission from utilities to 
connect to an existing power source.  Streetlights are generally not metered, and therefore, 
non-conforming loads  are typically prohibited without a formal “per location” agreement  
between the utility and municipality.  In this new future, cities can add ITS sensors, micro cells, 
Wi-Fi radios, other powered sensors, EV charging stations, banner lights (seasonally popular) 
etc. without this onerous utility application process.  
Finall y, the local utility, San Diego Gas & Electric  (SDG&E) , began investigating the feasibility of 
metered streetlights more than two years ago, with the result being the filing in 2015 of one of 
the nation’s first metered streetlight tariffs.  This tariff is slated for implementation in 2016.  For 
the past several years, numerous cities within the greater San Diego area have been pre -
positioning themselves to create this policy tariff framework just to enable this smart city 
platform, including Oceanside.  Wha t this means is that the region is poised to build their 
regional smart city visions around this construct of metered power distributed to every corner 
of the city atop 30 foot high streetlights.  
Technical Approach  
In this section we will present our techn ical approach to achieving our strategy, starting with a 
recap of the progress made to date.   
Foundation Investments Made  
The City of Oceanside has been strategically laying the groundwork to build its ICT platform, 
independently of the USDOT’s efforts, f or several years.  To date, the City has invested in the 
following:  
1. Intelligent Transportation  Systems (ITS)  
a. Central Signal Management System (CSMS)  
b. 150 signal intersections, with 140 intersections ITS -enabled to facilitate signal 
synchronization.  
c. 38 CCTV cameras at ITS -enabled intersections .  20 more CCTVs planned  
d. Traffic Management Center  
e. Emergency Vehicle Response Preemption System  
f. Driver Feedback Signs. Approximately 15  OCEANSIDE 20/20

transportation plan 
3.ICT Platfo rm
a.23 miles of City-owned Fiber Optic cabling
currently connecting 140 intersections.
b.Distributed utility-grade metered power
grid atop the 7,661 streetlights.
Oceanside chose the GE Light Grid platform for this application.
c.Investment of $1.2 million (Light Grid) plus $1.0 million for FO.
Immediate Next Phase of Development 
The next phase of development involves the integration of the backhaul networks for both the 
existing ITS platform and the emerging ICT platform.  Integration engineering is currently 
underway to utilize existing city FO cabling to operate both the distributed metered power 
system atop streetlights and existing ITS infrastructure. 
2016 Plans 
Oceanside has an aggressive Fiber Optic expansion 
plan.  In 2016 installation of an additional four 
miles of FO are planned.  Also, in 2016 a pilot 
project is being implemented across the City’s 
proposed test area to evaluate TrafficCast’s 
BlueTOAD, a device that counts vehicles by 
monitoring Blue Tooth devices found on drivers, 
passengers and within vehicles.  This represents 
the City’s next step in integrating traffic sensors 
beyond the current use of roadway pucks. 
Once the ICS Platform is established, the City will 
begin expanding the installation of traffic monitoring sensors to build out the dynamic traffic 
monitoring system.  Early field tests are about to commence with the evaluation of BlueTOAD 
devices to count blue-tooth enabled vehicles.    
Should Oceanside be the successful City, we plan to integrate the Blue TOAD data as a real-
time data source to our dynamic traffic monitoring system, complemented by other to-b e-
identified technologies, including sensors that can see vehicular Wi-Fi, and cameras that can 
distinguish between vehicle types and pedestrians.

2017 and Beyond 
Oceanside has ambitions plans to expand both the ITS infrastructure and ICT infrastructure with 
FIPS compliance as a central strategy.   FIPS will be required because streetlights will eventually 
be used for Smart Grid applications, delivery of city services, support emergency response, and 
shared with the public.  This will trigger streetlights being designated “Critical Infrastructure,” 
which has federal regulatory definition.  Furthermore, the City works closely with the local 
transit authority, NCTD , and the regional traffic planning authority, San Diego Association of 
Governments (SANDAG), to be consistent with regional objectives.  Long term plans call for: 
1.Changeable Message Signs
2.Transit Signal Priority, providing buses priority access to maintain schedules
3.Encourage citizens to adopt electric vehicles through public education in partnership
with SDG&E;
4.Expanded installation of charging stations, including e-bikes.
5.Decarbonization of City’s electrical grid.  T he City is starting to explore Community
Choice Aggregation to facilitate the purchase of clean power.  In addition, the City is
expanding the installation of solar power. In 2014 installing about one mW of solar
generation capacity alone was installed at the City’s waste water treatment plant,
complementing the installation of a methane-fueled co-generation facility, recycling
waste methane gas.
6.511 Public Traffic Monitoring System,  by phone or Internet.
7.Smart Parking Systems to enhance tourism.
8.Enable autonomous, Vehicle- To-Vehicle (VTV) and Vehicle- To-Infrastructure ( VTI)
communication with its mobile ICT platform to utilize the dynamic traffic flow
monitoring system
9.Design and Installation of a terrestrial based three dimensional GPS system, (3D
Terrestrial GPS), introducing the z value (elevation) to the traditional x, y coordinate
satellite -based GPS system.  These beacons will be placed atop streetlights, solving the
urban canyon effect when high rise buildings block satellite GPS signals.  Adding the z
coordinate can also provide more accurate location of IoT devices and vehicles.  This can
enable a new three-dimensional way of tracking and supporting the guidance of moving
objects, preparing the way for expanded use of, for example, drone package delivery.
This also has National Security implications in the event of a star-wars type attack on US
GPS satellites.   A terrestrial positioning system can serve as an emergency backup,
allowing GPS devices to continue to operate should satellites be destroyed.
10.Utilization of an Enterprise Funding Strategy to organically grow the ICT platform across
the City, integrating FO and Wi-Fi mesh ICT elements everywhere.
As we implement the ICT platform, we will begin integrating new ITS technologies. 
The Mobile Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Platform 
Oceanside is moving forward with plans to invest in this new mobile ICT platform, The OMNI-
Mesh Network.  Oceanside’s plans call for The OMNI-Mesh Network t o support the following: OCEANSIDE 20/20  
The OMNI -Mesh Network

1. Efficient integration of sensors along all city streets to dynamically monitor traffic flow 
everywhere, not just at intersections.  
2. City communications services, including fire, police, operations and maintenance, etc.  
(cost sharing opportunity)  
3. Water and Gas Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)  (cost sharing opportunity)  
4. Delivery of Wi -Fi service to targeted low income neighborhoods (public service  
5. Sharing of Wi-Fi capacity with telecomm carriers (revenue generating opportunity)  
6. Advanced Parking systems – identification of available parking spots by citizens, 
reducing time looking for parking in congested downtown areas.  
7. Use of Public Wi-Fi to enable the sharing economy.  
8. This is just a short list of services and capab ilities that can utilize streetlights.  We have a 
longer roadmap of 45 functions and services that benefit from connected smart 
streetlights . 
Oceanside plans to pursue the design and installation of a mesh Wi-Fi communications platform 
using the unlicensed  5 GHz spectrum .  This platform will be able to connect city services 
everywhere, with the backhaul linked to the City’s burgeoning fiber optic network currently 
connecting the City’s ITS signaling system.  The “mesh” component of the system will efficient ly 
link streetlights together, with the eventual data signal being ported back to the City’s 
operations center via fiber optic cable.  We will be investigating as part of our plan, whether 
individual devices connecting to the mesh Wi-Fi at individual stree tlights will be “tethered” 
through a 2. 4 GHz star-topology approach for connecting mobile end devices.  
Why Mesh Wi-Fi? 
Perhaps the most strategic reason to utilize mesh Wi-Fi is because of latency, which is the time 
delay created when data is shared or mov ed about.   In a growing world of IoT integration, this is 
a really big issue as sensors positioned atop streetlights need to support many applications in a 
real-time automation environment.  Carrier c ellular networks cannot overcome this latency 
issue  beca use they are closed systems .  Milliseconds matter , especially in large, Smart City 
networks .  We will follow the Wi -Fi Alliance Passport 2.0 / 3.0 standards as our starting point.  
System Architecture and Implementation Footprint  
Shown on the following pag es are:  
1. Exhibit 1, a high level System Architecture schematic  
2. Exhibit 2, a technical schematic of the proposed mesh Wi-Fi ICT platform.  
3. A map of the city, depicting existing ICT and ITS installation, including the Traffic 
Management Center.  Also shows the  planned first phase of deployment area 
surrounding the beaches, the pier and the urban downtown shopping district.  
These illustrations, when taken together, identify how Oceanside will build out its ICT platform 
atop streetlights.  It starts to become qui te evident when one studies the citywide map of the 
streetlight network the ideal nature of sensors everywhere will act as the “nerve endings” to 
detect and communicate information back to the Analytics platform.  OCEANSIDE  20/20

System Architecture  Schematic  
Below is a high level graphic describing the core elements of Oceanside’s planned Smart City platform.   The centerpiece of the 
platform is the integrated data highway of fiber optic cabling and the mobile ICT platform.  New applications, especi ally 
applications that automate things, can now be safely added, integrating cell phone apps as the means for public interaction and 
use.  This framework is the platform for delivering services in the new IoT economy.  The next Uber, Lyft, Google or Facebo ok will 
likely emerge from this technology environment.

Data Analytics  
The power of the ICT / ITS integration becomes fully realized when the system is operational and the 
Analytics engine is integrated.  There are two components to analytics in the Oceanside model:  
1. Field Automation Analytics.  Resides on devices an d streetlight controllers.  Reads local 
sensors, automating field devices.  
2. Enterprise Analytics.  Resides in the cloud, capturing macro data for deep system analysis, 
and the vehicle for providing access to publicly available analytics data to encourage 3rd 
party developers to build new businesses.  
Together these analytics tools provide the means for the City to:  
1. Improve lives by giving citizens insights that can help them decide whether to use private or  
public transport.  
2. Improve city services by enabling emergency vehicles to get to their destination faster by 
knowing in advance if a road is closed or traffic detoured.  
3. Lower costs to businesses because they can schedule travel and other logistics during 
offpeak  times.  
4. Improve people’s experience at public events or tourist sites by providing spectators smart 
phone apps that can help them quickly find the most convenient parking.  
Quality of life is enhanced as stress related to traffic congestion falls.  With this powerful toolkit, 
traffic planners ca n now think about dynamic traffic signal control, with a core metric now 
measurable – vehicle idling hours while stuck in traffic.  Optimum travel times can be now be 
continuously compared to current travel times, with signals dynamically changing duration s to 
minimize congestion and traffic signal idling.  This directly translates to reduced greenhouse gas

emissions.  We envision a system that will learn from itself, constantly refining the traffic signal 
algorithms directing signal controllers driven by c onstantly monitored traffic flow.  
When Vehicle to Vehicle (VTV) and Vehicle to Infrastructure ( VTI) technology becomes ubiquit ous as 
standards are adopted and technology advances, the ICT platform will enable a new generation of 
automation whereby the veh icle speed may be regulated so it never comes to a complete stop while 
in route to its destination, the ultimate GHG reduction goal .    In the end, it is the Data Analytics that 
enable the seamless integration of multiple city functions as depicted in this  graphic provided by 
IBM, providing command and control, as well as situational awareness of the entire city field of 
operations.  
Standards -based Architecture  – A Strategic View  
Taking a Standards -based architecture approach is a bit more complicated once the FIPS -based 
“critical infrastructure” strategy is applied.  To address differing security requirements  of different 
systems (Traffic, Police, Utilities, Public, etc.) sharing a  standards based common platform ICT 
model, we need to integrate more than ju st the USDOT’s emerging ITS standards  govern ing VTI 
communications .  We also need to consider the Smart Grid cyber security standards as defined by 
the US Department of Energy and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).   For 
example, we see a major opportunity to integrate the backhaul communications requirements of 
utility companies connecting to a common ICT platform.  Connecting Smart Meters and Smart Grid 
assets located within cities will eliminate or dramatically reduce unsightly urban c lutter on 
streetlights.  As a result, w e are recommending a cross -functional workshop be convened with 
appropriate participation among the following federal agencies:  
 U.S. Department of Transportation –ITS requirements  
 U.S. Department of Commerce – NIST re quirements  
 U.S. Department of Energy – Smart Grid Requirements  
 U.S. Department of Defense – command and control requirements to support advances in 
formal Consequence Management involving U.S. communities adjacent to military bases.  
 Homeland Security  
An example of why this matters illustrated is demonstrated within the plans of Southern California 
Edison (SCE), one of the nation’s largest electr ical utilities, with a 50,000 square mile service 
territory.  They currently own about 50,000 radios linking the ir assets (substations, transmission 
lines, power distribution vaults, etc.  These two -way communications devices automate switching to 
assist with restoring power in the event of an outage.  Their plans call for expansion of this radio 
backhaul system to grow to over 250,000 radios within the next five years.  And they have 
strategically targeted the use of streetlights to attach these radios.  The use of these radios will 
eventually, if not already, fall within the purview of the Smart Grid cyber security  standards as these 
standards are implemented.   Left unchecked, unsightly urban clutter will ensue. T his also 
represents a revenue / cost -sharing opportunity for the city as Oceanside provisions capacity of the 
ICT platform to the local utility, allowing utility radios to talk to the ICT platform.   OCEANSIDE 20/20

Additional System Requirements – E-Commerce and 3rd Party Developers  
Oceanside, building on its Smart City infrastructure investments to date, plans to open up the ICT 
platform to 3rd party developers creat ing the opportunity for  new applications by business start -ups 
and established technology companies to “Invent in Oceanside!”  We envision a future where 
emerging technologies, not just transportation technologies, can use the City’s ICT platform to 
invent.  T he City plans to organically grow sharing and service economy  businesses , two of the 
fastest growing business sectors.  To enable 3rd part developer thrive, the metered field controllers 
atop streetlights, will deploy Standard Too Kit and API calls, with t he appropriate cyber security 
protocols  in place to assure only authorized personnel can deploy atop the ICT platform.  
Program Management Approach  
Program Management will be led by the City.  It starts with a clear Statement of Work, as well as 
Goals and O bjectives as described in this proposal.  It includes a work plan, an organizational 
structure, and a funding mechanism to assure all work is complete.  Below is Oceanside’s Program 
Management Plan to carry out the vision described with this paper.  It sta rts with a clear 
understanding of how the program will be organized.  
The Oceanside Business Model  – Paying It Forward  
Oceanside, like most cities, started down its Smart City path without available funds.  California’s 
energy efficiency policy environment timing was just right.  City after city in the San Diego region 
has converted to LEDs atop streetlights.  And each city was able to finance the LED investment with 
ZERO money out of pocket.  Oceanside went one step further, investing in the metered streetl ight 
control network at the initial LED deployment.  The energy dollar savings were so great that the City 
did not have to come out of pocket to pay for its first ICT lighting controls platform .  Now, with the 
advent of the new metered streetlight rate, Oc eanside will now be free to repurpose streetlights to 
expand the ITS footprint while supporting integration of other city services, then invite 3rd party 
developers to work in Oceanside, while offering Wi -Fi bandwidth to the telecomm carriers to 
offload gr owing Smart Phone traffic.  As a result of these developments, Oceanside now envisions 
the implementation of a special Enterprise fund, whereby new revenues are tapped and operational 
efficiencies unlocked, the monetization of these benefits will pay for t he network expansion .   OCEANSIDE 20/20

The Oceanside Partners - A Public Private Partnership  (P3) 
While Oceanside is motivated, owns and /or controls the streetlights and related rights of ways, 
and has demonstrated commitment to Smart City development through its forward leaning 
investments in streetlights, it cannot go it alone.  And most important i t owns and /  or controls 
the streetlights within public rights -of-way.  To build its future, Oceanside has sought support 
from the private sector.  Today, Oceanside is actively working with the following technology 
and implementation channel partners to en able its vision:  
1. IBM. Cloud Analytics.  City analytics and services deliver business efficiencies.  
2. Intel Corporation.  Latest IoT chipsets.  
3. Convergence Wireless – Mesh Streetlight Controllers, Fiber Optic backhaul, Technical 
Architecture and integration de sign.  Convergence’s wireless technology currently 
approved for use in GSA buildings across the United States.  
4. Intella star – embedded analytics  
5. Ultra 3eTi.  US DOD Wi -Fi Telecommunications Security Expertise.   
6. Southern Contracting.  LED streetlight architect and program manager.   
The core team is unique in that it fully understands and has implemented FIPS -based cyber -
secure networks.  They have all previously worked together, in one form or another, on directl y 
relevant projects.  Each of these firms have met with, and/or indicated a formal willingness to 
support, the City of Oceanside.  One or more of above firms will participate in the formation of 
a P3 to design, build, operate and maintain the ICT platform,  protecting the City from 
technology obsolescence.  Below is a deeper look at each committed team member.  
IBM 
IBM’s Industry Smarter Solutions Team (ISST) their  Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) 
team are collaborating with both Convergence Wireless,  Inc. to use their Broadband Wireless 
Streetlights (BWS) offering and Intellastar’s real -time control and embedded analytics to 
increase the sensing and actuation granularity by leveraging the ubiquity of light infrastructure 
existing power drops and the B WS offering’s ability to become the “Smart City Backbone .” This 
will enable not just the Department of Transportation’s Framework to utilize this unified 
communications wireless “fat pipe” wireless network, but numerous other stakeholders as well, 
all usin g their own separate VPN tunnels taking advantage of the true lock & key based 
authentication and encryption based cyber security.  
Intel Corporation  
Intel Corporation is supplying their new Internet of Things (IoT) modules to the Convergence 
Wireless Dual Radio Wi-Fi Streetlight System .  This Intel chipset is comprised of processors 
capable of performing automated image and analytics processing with sensor data collected 
from every streetlight. The entire team will be working closely with the City of Oceans ide on a n 
innovative implementation of the USDOT  Framework, which can then be scaled across the 
nation . OCEANSIDE 20/20

Convergence Wireless  
Convergence Wireless, Inc. (CWI) has the earliest patents for leveraging the existing lighting 
infrastructure (both indoor and outdoor) to enable the lowest cost and most ubiquitous 
Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) solutions in the market. CWI is 
able to accomplish this very bold statement because they take advantage of the existing and 
paid for pow er drops that the lighting infrastructure represents to a network. Power drops that 
are literally everywhere because of the need for lighting in everyday activities. They first control 
and monitor the lighting infrastructure itself to deliver energy saving s and electric grid peak 
demand automatic load shedding incentive capture from electric utilities, quickly paying for the 
technology cost and installation cost before reaching out to even more lucrative heretofore 
manual processes automation in operational  and m aintenance areas that IoT and I oT delivers.  
Intellastar  
Intellastar i s the embedded analytics technology provider to Convergence Wireless 
Corporation. Thus, the end nodes will have their own real -time controls capability, embedded 
analytics with real -time clock running entire schedules, sensing data gathering and even on 
board camera visual analytics the automate visual information so Control Cent er Personnel can 
focus on what m atters because automated analytics will create alarm conditions automatica lly 
with the camera based graphics. A portion of the Intellastar Analytics Engine will reside on the 
server side of the system and feed the real -time analytics data into the IBM USDOT  Framework 
Implementation cloud analytics servers.  
Ultra Electronics, 3eTi® 
Ultra Electronics, 3eTI® (3eTi)  is a leading provider of military -grade secure communications 
that enable critical systems security, infrastructure secu rity, and facilities management  for the

laboratories in order to insure that the ICT design meets stringent cyber -security standards and 
a robust cyber -security profi le. 
Southern Contracting  
Southern Contracting is the local electrical general contractor with the “boots” on the ground.  
Southern designed, installed and commissioned the entire streetlights metering network and is 
assisting the City develop its Smart Cit y plan described here.  Southern organized a formal 
rese arch program among the cities of San Diego and Chula Vista, SDG&E (local utility), and the 
California Lighting Technol ogy Center (CLTC) to vet the first generation of metered lighting 
controls, leadin g to the nation’s first smart meter streetlight tariff.   Southern also designed, 
installed and commissioned the city of San Diego’s 3,000 streetlight controls network spanning 
the downtown urban area of the nation’s 8th largest city.   Southern will assist Oceanside to lead 
the development and implementation of the proposed program and the P3 partnership.  
Envisioned Regional Agency Partnerships  
Beyond this capable team, Oceanside is entering into and/or seeking to enter into partnership 
arrangements with:  
1. The San Diego Association of Governments ( SANDAG ), the r egional traffic planning 
agency  
2. North County Transit Authority (NCTD) , the local transit authority .  Headquartered in 
Oceanside, NCTD manages the light rail (S PRINTER ), train ( COASTER) , bus ( BREEZE ) and 
last-mile ( LIFT AND FLEX ) transportation network serving North San Diego County.   
NCTD has also executed interoperability agreements with BNSF Railway, Southern 
California Regional Rail Authority (SCRRA) METROLINK commuter service, AMTRACK 
and Pacific S un Railroad.  
3. University of California San Diego (UCSD).  UCSD has been conducting primary and 
applied research for the past several years on the design and deployment of sensors 
atop streetlights under the banner of the Sentinel Program.    
4. Caltrans.  State wide transportation authority. We want to explore and develop the ICT 
technology platform to eventually integrate Caltrans -controlled signaled intersections 
into the ICT platform, supporting system -wide signal synchronization.  
5. US DOD, Camp Pendleton.  We p lan to explore and integrate common communications 
protocols in support of Consequence Management requirements.  
The City has already opened preliminary discussions with each of these agencies and will 
solidify their support as the City proceeds.  
Partnershi p Governance  
The City envisions the P3 to be structured within the City’s provisions to oversee this strategic 
plan, and assure goals and objectives are met.  Appropriate City representatives will govern the 
enterprise effort .  This will assure the funds a re prioritized toward the City’s Smart City 
Infrastructure implementation.  OCEANSIDE 20/20

Requested Grant Application Information  
Presented on the following pages are detailed responses to the series of questions posed in the 
NOFO.  
Oceanside’s Alignment with the Characteristics and Vision Elements of a Smart City  
Population Characteristics  
Oceanside should be considered an ideal candidate because of how well we align with the 
Smart City characteristics described in the NOFO.  Our 2010 census population of about 
167,086 falls a bit short of the population guideline .  However, it is worth noting that Oceanside 
is a resort destination, and with major events on holiday s or weekends , the population within 
the downtown target development zone can swell by more than 100,0 00.  In addition, Camp 
Pendleton, the Marine training base, shares a common border and is home to more than 
30,000 permanent residents.  Oceanside thinks and acts like a much larger mid -sized American 
city described in this NOFO.  In addition, Oceanside’s demographics are among the most diverse 
in California, more reflective of the nation as a whole when compared to other similar -sized 
cities.

Other Relative Smart City Attributes  
1. Urban Density.   Oceanside is the 18th most densely populated city in the nation, with 
3,978.2 residents per square mile. Oceanside repr esents 6% of the overall population of 
the greater urbanized San Diego area.  
2. Existing Public Transport System .  The Oceanside Transit Center (OTC) is one of the 
busiest transit centers in San Diego County, with more than 1.2 million annual 
passengers board ing trains and buses.  OTC connects transit services between San 
Diego, Orange, Los Angeles and Riverside counties.   OCEANSIDE 20/20  
The OMNI -Mesh Network  
Page | 22 
 
The North County Tr ansportation District (NCTD) is  headquartered in downtown 
Oceanside near the OTC and oversees to a robust network which  provides more than 
12.5 million passenger trips per y ear in North San Diego County.  NCTD renders services 
which include the BREEZE bus, the SPRINTER light rail, the COASTER commuter train, the 
FLEX demand response, and the LIFT paratransit service.  The City of Oceanside is a 
League of American Cyclists Bronze Level Bicycle -Friendly Community.  The head of the 
Coastal Rail Bike Trail starts in Oceanside and is augmented by the fact that the Coaster, 
the Sprinter, and the Breeze all allow bicycle transport .  The City also has an extensive 3 -
level bicycle network connecting the City guided by the City’s bicycle mobility plan . 
3. Conducive Environment .  Oceanside has invested more than $ 6 million in fiber optic 
cabling, advanced LED streetlights and streetlight metering system and is in the process 
of integrating the ITS  and streetlight networks with a common backhaul.  The City is well 
on its way to enabling its Smart City future.  In add ition, the local utility, SDG&E, is about 
to implement one of the nation’s first metered streetlight tariffs, supporting the 
acceleration of Smart City technologies and deployments.   
4. Continuity of Committed Leadership .  The City Council, City Manager , Chief Engineer, 
and various departments, including IT, Transportation , Police, Fire and Utility Services, 
are fully committed to Oceanside’s Smart City future.  
5. Sharing Economy .  Oceanside’s very ICT platform is being been strategically designed to 
enable 3rd part development.  The City’s leadership intends to start discussions this year 
to attract new business that will thrive in Oceanside, fast becoming a leading connected 
city.  Linkages with Social Media, consumer apps uti lizing traffic flow data, and s mart 
city programs designed to engage the public are all in early formulation stages.  
6. Shared Data .  As with Oceanside’s plans to help stand up sharing economy business 
constructs, Oceanside is fully committed to making the data collected through the ICT 
platform available to the public (public at large, other agencies, 3rd part developers, 
itself through its Enterprise Cloud Platform) to acceleration of its Smart City ambitions.  
Appropriate provisions will be made to protect privacy through data de -identif ication, 
and restricted access to distributed cloud data driving machine -to-machine interfaces.  
Vision Elements  
Below is a review of the USDOT Vision Elements and how Oceanside aligns.    
Technology Elements  
1. Urban automation  is the heart of the ICT platform .  Designed by proven automation 
experts with a focus on meeting FIPS -compliant cyber -security standards.   
2. Connected Vehicles  cannot function safely without being connected to a truly secure 
ICT platform.  Oceanside is leaning forward with this proposal t o identify and solve this 
strategic conundrum.  The ICT platform needs be share data among many stakeholders, 
including Traffic and Transportation management.   
3. Intelligent Sensor -based infrastructure  is at the heart of our mesh Wi-Fi enabled ICT 
platform,  eliminating or minimizing latency in support of automation best practices.  OCEANSIDE 20/20  
The OMNI -Mesh Network  
Page | 23 
 
Smart City Elements   
1. Architecture and Standards .  The ICT platform is being architected with not just the 
USDOT standards in mind, but also other stakeholders, including NIST, US DOD and US 
DOE.  
2. Low -cost resilient technology .  The ICT platform is using commercial Wi -Fi Alliance 2.0 / 
3.0 standards to assure widespread acceptance.  
3. Smart Land Use .  In 2009, the City of Oceanside adopted the Coast Highway Vision and 
Strategic Plan. This plan serves as a blueprint for the revitalization and enhancement of 
the Coast Highway corridor between Harbor Drive in the north and Buena Vista Lagoon 
in the south. The Vision and Strategic Plan includes several recommendations to 
transform Coast Hi ghway from an auto -oriented thoroughfare into a “complete street” 
that serves all modes of transportation from automobiles to  pedestrians to bicyclists 
and transit vehicles.  
The City of Oceanside is now embarking on an effort to study and begin the design 
process for the street enhancements and changes proposed as part of the Vision and 
Strategic Plan. This effort, called the Coast Highway Corridor Study, will assess existing 
and future transportation conditions along the corridor and on surrounding streets  in 
order to identify  the preferred approach to implementing the recommendations 
contained in the Coast Highway Vision and Strategic  Plan.  
The study effort will focus on assessing projects that are consistent with the Vision and 
Strategic Plan and address the needs of the community through:  
 Improving pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure with a focus on safety and comfort, 
enhancing access to transit.  
 Modifying the roadway with improvements such as roundabouts to improve traffic 
flow.  
 Improving parking acc ess to businesses along the corridor.  
 Encouraging economic development through improvements in mobility and the 
public streetscape.  
The ICT platform will be a key tool used by city traffic planners to enable these goals.  
Traffic patterns will be character ized using the dynamic sensor -enabled ICT platform.  
Furthermore, the City is now able to make informed decision about new streetlight 
dimming plans with even more energy savings to come  by overlaying dimmable 
streetlights GIS layer with the City zone map GIS layer .  Integrating traffic pattern 
analysis to the ICT platform will enable even more advanced analytical analysis and

1. Urban Analytics .  The ICT platform is being architected from the ground up with a 
distributed, two -layered analytics architecture.  This provides the framework for field 
automation and support of the automation requirements of connected vehicles, while 
feeding the analytics engine residing in the Cloud.   Cloud analytic s provides separation OCEANSIDE 20/20

of machine -to-machine automation security elements, data access by agencies and the 
public, and support of 3rd part development of new technology and shared economy 
businesses.  
2. Urban Delivery and Logistics .  Oceanside will be explorin g the design and deployment of 
a terrestrial 3D GPS component, using streetlights as GPS beacons to enable delivery 
automation.  
3. Strategic Business and Partnership Models .  Oceanside, through its planned P3 and 
Enterprise Fund approach, has been committed f rom the beginning to both find a 
working business model to enable its future, but also provide an example for other cities 
to follow.  Oceanside has learned how to withdraw from the Bank of Energy Efficiency 
and monetize energy savings to pay for its first  wave of Smart City systems like 
streetlights.  Combining the value proposition inherent in public mesh Wi -Fi with this 
new P3/Enterprise Fund business model, Oceanside welcomes the opportunity to share 
lessons learned with other cities.  
4. Smart Grid Roadway  Electrification .  All these capabilities are being provided for, by 
design, within the ICT architecture.  In fact, expansion of the Smart Grid will find major 
economies of scale by piggybacking onto this Smart Streetlight construct as Smart 
Meters and pla nned radio deployments to connect utility infrastructure in support of a 
more secure and resilient grid are achieved through a co -op agreement between the 
local utilities and the City.  
5. Connected Involved Citizens .  Oceanside will be exploring and developin g policies from 
the outset to not only engage its citizenry, but also provide subsidized access to low 
income neighborhoods so no family or child is left behind.  The Home Login Page will 
feature local businesses and city news.  
Twelve Vision Element Alignme nt  
Below is a detailed analysis of how Oceanside’s plans align with the twelve vision elements.  
1. Urban Automation .  As described above, this is the heart of the planned ICT platform.  
Designed by automation and cyber -security experts from the ground up  to support low -
latency automation everywhere across the City . 
2. Connected Vehicles (VTI) .  The ICT platform designed to securely scale the deployment 
of VTI interaction around automation design principles.  The common ICT platform 
shares duty with many othe r stakeholders as well , including fire, police, utilities, and 
telecomm carriers . 
3. Intelligent, Sensor -based infrastructure .  The basis of the ICT Platform, addressing the 
requirements of sensors to operate in a real -time automation environment.  
4. Urban Analy tics.  System will deploy distributed analytics, analytics at the edge to 
support automation, and analytics at the enterprise level to support policy and planning, 
as well as support of identifying and incentivizing the development of new services.  
5. User -focused mobility services and choices .  Integration with NCTD’s transit system, of 
rail, light rail, bus, bike and last mile transport, providing apps that will offer mobility OCEANSIDE 20/20  
The OMNI-Mesh Network

choices balancing convenience, travel time and cost.  For example The City is just 
starting to explore e-bike charging stations around the downtown area, and a consumer 
app that shows both the location of an open charging station, but also links to nearby 
businesses as a way of encouraging expanded e-bike usage. starting  
6.Urban Delivery and logistics .  Oceanside’s plans to support the investigation and
development of a 3D terrestrial GPS system atop streetlights will support new package
delivery modes when combined with the dynamic traffic data platform.
7.Strategic Business Models and Partnering opportunities .  The business model
framework consists of a combination of an Enterprise Fund and a P3 to bring the ICT
platform to life.
8.Smart Grid, Roadway electrification and Electric Vehicles.   Smart Grid integration is one
of many revenue / cost sharing opportunities to fund the expansion of the ICT.  Utilities
will be able to connect their Smart Grid assets through the common ICT platform.
Charging stations can connect their meter and charging transaction to the Wi-Fin mesh,
providing not just a fueling transaction, but the connected vehicle can monitor the best
available route to shopping destinations, homes, EV charging stations, etc.
9.Connected, involved citizens . Citizen involvement will be assured as the public will have
access to the Wi- Fi system with the log-in page generating revenue through banner ads
and while providing Public Service announcements.
10.Architectural Standards .  The City will be working closely with the development team to
emerging USDOT standards, NIST FIPS standards, and USDOE Smart Grid standards.
11.Low-cost ICT .  Enhanced revenue directed through an Enterprise fund approach will
assure low cost access to the platform by everyone through a co-opting strategy of a
shared ICT platform connecting government, businesses and citizens.
12.Smart Land Use .  As new businesses and services are implemented, deployments will be
designed with the City’s zoning map as a backdrop to understand the impact on the
community.  Spatial awareness is key when using existing rights- of-way.
The three highest priority element, Urban Automation, Connected Vehicles and Intelligent Sensor-Based 
Infrastructure are addressed head on with our ICT platform, The OMNI-Mesh Network.  Urban 
Automation is addressed through the system architecture being designed by automation experts, not 
just network architects.  Connected vehicle security will be addressed through the integration of our 
FIPS-compliance design strategy with emerging USDOT VTI standards. The application of Wi-Fi Alliance 
Passport 2.0 / 3.0 standards to the design of our mesh Wi- Fi-based OMNI-Mesh Network will 
assure low latency integration of sensors atop streetlights across the City to the most current 
standards, further supporting cross-functional usage of OM NI-Mesh beyond ITS applications.  
Technical, Policy and institutional Risks 
There are several technical, policy and institutional risk associated with our plan.  Here are the 
key risks we have identified. OCEANSIDE 20/20  
The OMNI -Mesh Network  
Page | 26 
 
1. Tariff Risks .  Metered Streetlight Utility Energy Tariffs in infancy state.  There needs to 
be a concerted organized effort to expand metered streetlights.  Current flat rate tariffs 
restrict what cities can do with their streetlights.  
2. Streetlight Control .  Streetlight ownership is not universal.  Cities need to buy their 
streetlights, and then convert to LED as their Smart City starting roadmap starting point.  
This process can take up to two years when a city d ecides to move forward.   
3. Timing Risk .  Integration with emerging USDOT VTI standards will be constrained by the 
actual USDOT t imetable.  Preliminary data structures need to be assessed / integrated . 
4. Security .  The USDOT needs to assure that the ICT platform is secure to the highest FIPS 
standards . Streetlights  are the natural place to ubiquitously install traffic monitoring 
senso rs, and will soon be formally classified as “Critical Infrastructure,” along with other 
elements of the Smart Grid.  The USDOT needs to take a forward -leaning position on 
this to minimize 1) security breach risk, and 2) the risk of independent data / 
commu nication silos cluttering cityscapes with radios and devices.   
5. Implementation Risk .  A common, sensor -enabled ICT platform IS the most economical 
way to share data among agencies and the public to enable automation, IoT based 
applications to thrive in the  emerging new world economy.  
Additional risks include, construction risks, operations and maintenance (O&M) risks, 
entitlement risks, environmental risks and analytics risks.  The City will develop  a formal Risk 
Mitigating plan to address each.  
City Trans portation System  
The City of Oceanside, situated adjacent to Camp Pendleton, is located in North San Diego 
County along the I5 corridor connecting San Diego with Los Angeles.  The City’s roadways 
include:  
1. Interstate Five (I5) -- 4 miles . 
2. Highway 78 Freeway  (SR-78) -- 7 miles  
3. Highway 76 Expressway (SR-76) -- 10 miles  
4. Roadway Arterials  -- 114 miles  
In addition, Oceanside is home to the headquarters of NCTD and the OTC, a multi -modal center 
linking buses, light rail, trains, taxis and bicycles to inland and coastal municipal transportation 
networks.  Amtrak and Metrolink also use the transit center, linking Oceanside with the rest of 
California and the United States.   The City has two electric vehicle charging locations located 
around the City , including 14 c harging stations at the OTC and one at Mossy Nissan, Oceanside .  
Long term plans call for expansion as EVs become more popular.  The City’s transportation plan 
calls for initiation of an educational program to encourage EV adoption.  
City Data Collected  
The City Transportation Management Center (TMC) serves as a central data collection center 
where real -time information is gathered from many sources such as CCTV cameras and traffic 
signals via Citywide a fiber optic network, a 16 -panel video wall, and 38 CCT V cameras at key OCEANSIDE 20/20  
The OMNI-Mesh Network 
Page | 27 
signalized intersections.  The data received at the TMC enables the City traffic engineers to 
monitor and optimize traffic in real-time to ensure a fast, intelligent and coordinated response 
is made to improve traffic operations on the circulation system.  This information and the 
associated response measures are managed through a software application know as an 
Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS).  The TMC allows traffic engineers to monitor 
and adjust traffic signal plans during special events, as well as implement real-time 
transportation management measures at incident locations.   
Phase II of the TMC is currently underway, which consists expanding the existing fiber optic 
backbone along Coast Highway, Oceanside Boulevard, El Camino Real, and College Boulevard, 
adding more CCTV cameras at signalized intersections, and enhancing collection and provision 
of traveler information (with the use of changeable message signs and inter-jurisdictional 
traveler information sharing on a regional level known as the 511 Program) during daily and 
peak traffic periods and/or emergency situations.  Additionally, the implementation of 
BlueTOAD technology currently being integrated into the City’s TMC which directly determines 
travel time, speeds, and origin-destination at select locations by matching Bluetooth signals 
from passing vehicles.   
Cross-Functional Integration with Other City Services 
It is Oceanside’s strategic intent to use the Mesh -Wi-Fi enabled mobile ICT system to support all 
city services.  One of the key goals of the City’s ITS / ICT technical approach is to enable the 
dynamic collection of data through a sensor-based network atop streetlights.  This data will be 
directly linked to the ITS system to support automated adaptive signaling, enhancing Level Of 
Service (LOS) targets.  This data will drive the advanced deployment of adaptive signal control, 
while providing data to support long term transportation plans consistent with land use plans.  
Furthermore, the mesh Wi-Fi will support other city services by design.   
Existing Policies, Ordinances and Enacted Legislation 
Oceanside has a formal policy that the information gathered is made available to the public.  
Specific to the City’s ITS platform, a written policy is in place to ensure compliance with regional 
ITS architecture and National ITS standards where feasible to promote interoperability and 
information exchange with other agencies in the region.   A key goal of the ICT platform is to 
enable access to citizens as well, enhancing their work, play and living experience in Oceanside.  
This will be enabled through formal encouragement of new businesses and technologies to 
grow and thrive in Oceanside enabled through our mesh WI-FI enabled network that will 
support new mobility businesses.  We envision new ride sharing services to take advantage of 
gathered data, connecting riders with vehicles to travel to leisure, shopping and work 
destinations. 
Public Private Partnership (P3) Governance 
Oceanside is starting to formally explore the development of a Public-Private Partnership (P3) 
to implement, operate and maintain the ICT platform.  The detailed terms are yet to be worked 
out, with the goal to define cost sharing, annual budgeting, revenue sharing, and the co-OCEANSIDE 20/20  
The OMNI -Mesh Network  
Page | 28 
 
development of new 3rd party applications  and city services to enhan ce the Oceanside 
experience.  Through revenue sharing , the P3 partners will be incentivized to invest while taking 
on the O&M risk as well as technology obsolescence risk.  A key element of the P3 will be to 
define what information is available to whom and  when, with measures to protect privacy 
through appropriate system user de -identification techniques.  
Cyber -Security Certification  
Beyond the integration of USDOT, NIST and Smart Grid Standards described earlier, there is one 
more standard that needs to be  addressed – cyber -security.   Our planned ICT platform will 
comply with the below emerging standard because in this new IoT world, streetlights will be 
classified as “Critical Infrastructure.”  Recognizing that the national and economic security of 
the Uni ted States depends on the reliable functioning of critical infrastructure, the President 
issued Executive Order (EO) 13636 in February 2013, Improving Critical Infrastructure 
Cybersecurity .  The Order directed NIST to work with stakeholders to develop a voluntary 
framework – based on existing standards, guidelines, and practices - for reducing cyber risks to 
critical infrastructure. The Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 reinforced NIST's Executive 
Order 13636 role, which built upon the 2002 Homeland Security Act.  The entire system will be 
tested for adherence to the National Institutes of Standards and Technolo gy’s (NIST) Cyber 
Security Framework, which was released in February 2013, with complete testing being 
performed at NIST’s top cyber security contractor’s real -world lab located in Knoxville, TN, 
Enernex, Incorporated.  The NIST Cyber Security Framework in cludes adherence the United 
States Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 56a, 140 (all 4 levels), 180 (all versions), 
186 (all versions) , 197  (all versions), 198 (all versions) 200 (all versions), 201 (all versions), 800 -
21, 800 -38a and 800 -57.  We will secure the highest formal FIPS 140 -2 compliance certification 
as a result of this Executive Order.   
Program Performance Metrics  
A core measureable goal of the ITS system as it utilizes the collected dynamic traffic data, will 
be to improve Level O f Service (LOS) at all signaled and non -signaled intersections.  The City’s 
Traffic Plan has specific targets defined today based on intersection type and time of day.  What 
is being measured is the impact of traffic congestion on the daily lives of Oceans ide citizens and 
visitors.   Key metrics will plan to measure includes:  
1. Idling wait times  
2. Average speed along arteries and corridors  
3. Greenhouse Gas Emissions reduction calculation based on vehicle type and idling time 
(before and after comparison)  
4. LOS Improvements when compared to baseline targets.  
Right now we are projecting a 10% reduction in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, 15% 
reduction in vehicle stops, and an 8% reduction in fuel use.  OCEANSIDE 20/20

Capacity to Take on the Project  
Oceanside has the complete capac ity to take on a project of this magnitude.  When combined 
with the attached letters of support from our agency and private partners, t his proposal 
demonstrates the executive and partnership commitment.  By partnering with industry 
partners including IBM a nd Intel, we have the breadth of commitment necessary to deliver 
results.  Our infrastructure has been strategically developed to prepare for exactly the very 
Smart City vision articulated by the USDOT.  Finally , we have successfully installed more than 
$10 million in “smart” infrastructure improvement projects strategically designed to prepare 
just for this moment, demonstrating our management ability to achieve our plan.  Oceanside 
has strategically committed to move forward and we welcome support from th e USDOT to help 
realize our vision . 
Leveraging Federal Resources  
A core element of the Oceanside plan is to develop the Business Model for other cities to emulate.  
Central to this plan is to identify the first revenue sources, including carrier and utilit y network 
sharing, and develop / implement these first co -op offtake agreements.  We will then use this 
revenue to underwrite the investment expansion with third party banking funds  by monetizing  
these value streams.  We plan to explore leverag ing this mod el to build out a portion of the 
development downtown, extending and/reducing the investment made by the USDOT.  
Summary  
The USDOT is seeking the following outcomes to be achieved.  
 Improve Safety  – By using advanced technologies, including connected vehicle  technologies, to 
reduce the number of collisions, fatalities, and injuries.  
 Enhance Mobility  – By providing real -time traveler information and emerging mobility services 
to improve personal mobility for all citizens.  
 Address Climate Change  – By implemen ting advanced technologies / policies support ing a more 
sustainable relationship between transportation and the environment through fuel use and 
emissions reductions.  
Oceanside’s OMNI -Mesh Network  directly addresses each:  
1. Safety : Improved police and fire coordination and response times through enhanced 
communication and knowledge of fastest, most routes.  
2. Enhanced Mobility : Supporting local and regional traffic planning agencies develop 
better plans and services while enabling a new generation of entreprene urs invent the 
next big sharing economy.  “Invented in Oceanside !” 
3. Climate Change .  Dynamic traffic monitoring enabling VTI communications linking 
sensors with big analytics to enable new algorithms to monitor then regulate traffic 
flow, improving Level Of  Service (LOS).  This leads to reduced idl ing / GHG reductions.  
Advanced Vehicle -To-Vehicle Demonstration Plan  
Oceanside has clearly taken a different approach to supporting the USDOT and the nation with 
this proposal.  Should we become one of the five fin alist cities, we will actively engage with OCEANSIDE 20/20  
The OMNI-Mesh Network 
Page | 30 
USDOT partners and seek out transportation companies looking to demonstrate their 
technologies in Oceanside utilizing the OMNI-Mesh Network, like bus collision safety 
technology, in partnership with Oceanside and the NTCD.   
In closing, a key premise of our approach is that these new technologies, like bus collision 
safety, will be better supported when the OMNI Mesh Network is in place.  This cyber-secure 
ICT platform will also provide the networked environment enabling the placement and 
deployment of real-time traffic sensors.  Central to the technical approach of our plan is the 
expanded integration of traffic sensors midblock and at or near non-signaled intersections to 
create a dynamic real-time model of the Ci ty’s traffic flow.  This traffic flow database is 
consistent with the USDOT’s larger plans to integrate VTI technology, while providing the very 
data necessary to develop more accurate algorithms governing signal synchronization citywide. 
We are already installing BlueTOAD devices as part of the first phase of development in the 
targeted downtown development zone.  As part of this USDOT opportunity, we will be 
approaching additional traffic monitoring technology companies to complement the BlueTOAD 
technology (Vehicle / Passenger Blue Tooth Detection) to more accurately characterize vehicle 
type, vehicle direction, vehicle count and vehicle velocity.   We will also explore how we can 
monitor and characterize pedestrian traffic within our dense urban target development zone. 
We will develop our detailed program plan, budget and schedules integrating everything 
described in this proposal while simultaneously adding VTI capabilities consistent with current 
local and regional transportation plans.  This will support two key goals: 1) Integration of 
emerging USDOT ITS standards governing VTI and VTV communications, and 2) Demonstrate 
the very technologies that the USDOT is seeking to promote. 
Starting with a secure ICT platform designed from the ground up for mobile and FO Smart City 
connectivity, Oceanside is a ready,-willing and able partner to enable a truly 21st Century Smart 
City architecture to share with the United States and the global community of cities.

 Smart City Challenge:  San José on the 
Move  
SAN JOSÉ’S VISION FOR A SMART CITY 
 
The City of San José is a city on the move.  From its early days as the Valley of Hearts Delight  to 
its current status as the Capital of Silicon Valley , San José is leading the way in developing new 
opportunities to meet its safety, mobility and sustainability needs.  As a city with a growing 
population with increasing transportation needs San José m ust look to new ways to move its 
residents in a safe manner through the use of innovation and technology.  
San José must provide a safe and reliable transportation network to a population that is expected to grow by nearly 50 percent by the year 2040, but that is experiencing transportation challenges today.  With a smaller population than most urban areas, San José is still one of the most congested.  According to an August 2015, Wall Street Journal article, residents of San José experienced 67 lost hours annually per commuter due to congestion at an annual cost of $1,422.  The total cost of the congestion cost the area $2.2 billion annually in both fuel costs and lost productivity.  Even with the smaller amount of population, San José's travel index of 1.38 is tied for third highest in the country and higher than the average index of 1.32 for urban areas with over three million people (Wall Street Journal).  The City's geography as well as the current expanding economy in Silicon Valley has added to the num ber of vehicles on the City's roadway 
system.  The increase in vehicles on the roads increases the need to look at innovative smart 
solutions to address the increased need for safety and mobility choices for San José's residents.
 
As the Capital of Silicon Valley, San José is uniquely positioned to leverage the knowledge and 
creativity of its citizens, corporate partners, and premier academic institutions to reimagine the role of technology and connectivity. “Smart City” is a ubiquitous term and means differ ent 
things to different stakeholders, yet the first step in identifying how best to utilize this grant if 
San José were to win is to define the values and vision of a SMART San José. 
 
A SMART  San José is:  
S – Safe  
Any traffic fatality in San José is unacce ptable. Consequently, San José has adopted and 
implemented Vision Zero San José, a comprehensive citywide  plan to eliminate all traffic 
fatalities as soon as possible. Technology and innovation will be a cornerstone to achieving Vision Zero, closely coupled with progressive engineering, education and enforcement strategies.  
Vision Zero San José
 
M- Multi -Modal  2 
 The City of San José has 2,432 miles of local streets, 243 miles of bike lanes, 16 miles of bike 
routes and 55 miles of trails, and residents have access to an extensive transit system that includes the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority’s (VTA) bus and light rail network.   Current and future construction of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system will provide residents with additional options to travel throughout the San José -San Francisco Bay Area.  A 
SMART San José will help enhance an already strong, connected and multi -modal transportation 
network through technology innovation solutions, such as advanced intersection communication and demand- based traffic management, privately and publicly developed applications, on 
demand transit services (VTA FLEX) and other emerging technologies.  
VTA FLEX
 
 
A- Activated  
San Jose has a diverse community surrounded by technology and business partners with a thriving downtown area. This community is rich in ethnic diversity and vibrant with sports, cultural activities, fine dining and cultural/residential amenities. There are many large shopping complexes with Santana Row being a c enterpiece of urban village activity.  As the Capital of 
Silicon Valley San José sits in the center of worldwide innovation with new emerging companies that are on the forefront of urban automation technologies. Within the City there is an area that has be en set aside for innovation -  the North San José Transportation Innovation Zone (TIZ).  
This initiative is a collaboration with Prospect Silicon Valley and other regional partners to provide a real life test lab for world class smart city innovation. A SMA RT San José will utilize 
innovation and technology to activate its diverse community.
 
Transportation Innovation Zone  
 
R- Responsive  
Our transportation infrastructure is already well on its way to being highly responsive allowing us to predict and respond to dynamic transportation needs. We have created a world class connected signal system and Traffic  Management Center (TMC), which all ows real time traffic 
management control. Our advanced systems and high tech TMC facility will be the foundation of future innovation that will further enhance our responsiveness. Intersections equipped with advanced sensors and controllers will respond to traffic patterns and ensure the efficient flow of 
traffic. We will add connectivity and intelligence to our existing infrastructure, and by using real -
time responsive data, the city will be able to provide a more efficient transportation system, such 
as on demand service to VTA riders.
 
Transportation Incident Management Center  
 
T- Transparent  3 
 As the City and its partners adopt advanced sensing and reporting technologies and pursue open 
data i nitiatives, government will be more accessible to those it serves than ever before. As data 
quality improves and real -time data- sets become more accessible, citizens can understand why 
traffic planning and deployment decisions are made and provide public -policy input. A SMART 
San José will develop and utilize improved dashboards and data analytics tools and provide open- source trend visualizations to increase public and private engagement. Open data will 
enable our public and private partnerships to thrive and will help build out services for our 
residents at a speed that has never been accomplished before.
 
San José Open Data Platform  
 
These values support the key tenets of what a “Smart City” should compris e; sensing, 
communicating and applying. We have very innovative and committed Government leaders from 
the mayor, Sam Liccardo, to our new Director of Transportation, Jim Ortbal, and a strong 
innovative partner in the VTA delivering world class public trans portation.  
Sam Liccardo's book “Safer  City, Smarter Government "" 
 
Approach  
Through transportation innovation, the City envisions addressing safety, mobility and 
sustainability through the citywide deployment of: 
• Connectivity through DSRC Technology –  CV/AV  
• Advanced Traffic Management  
• Smart Sensor Technologies  
• Data Analytics & Operational Dashboards  
• Electric Vehicle Solutions  
 
In our Smart City Challenge project:  
• We will build out a connected City utilizing Dedicated Short Range 
Communications  (DSRC) technology as a base communications platform to 
enable vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure connectivity.  
  
• We will utilize advanced traffic management  systems to roll -out adaptive and 
preemptive capability across the City, and provide a unique Transit Bus to bus 
stop customer experience. This will drive us towards achieving Vision Zero and further improving mobility for our City.  4 
 • We will implement smar t sensor technologies  across the City to enhance the 
focus on safety and mobility such as advanced traffic counts and collision 
avoidance for our transit buses.  
 
• We will use data analytic solutions  combined with advanced traffic counts, and 
transit bus mov ement to integrate with other infrastructure and software platforms 
to enhance SMART. An implementation of an operational dashboard will be 
undertaken where the smart technology can display through to a single point of 
reference for control and visibility.   
 
• We will further advance our electric vehicle solutions by developing a plan for 
wireless charging, converting diesel hybrid buses to Battery powered vehicles and 
utilizing current assets (smart streetlights, and light rail power distribution grid) to 
grow our already impressive electric vehicle charging fleet.  
 
As referenced above, San José is a Smart City  that can develop and demonstrate technologies 
that can be used by other cities to address many of the overlapping challenges that all cities face.  
In order to demonstrate technologies that can be replicated by others, San José has determined 
that four areas of the City would provide opportunities to concentrate the initial phased rollout 
and reflect many of the characteristics of other cities.  
 
While our vison is absolutely citywide, we have identified four areas where we would focus our 
initial implementation. These areas will enable us to concentrate on our safety, mobility and 
sustainability where they are most needed and most conducive for ev aluation, scalability and 
application in other cities.  
1. Transportation Innovation Zone (TIZ) –  located in North San José this technology 
industry rich area will provide a real -world testing ground for innovators looking at 
DSRC and CV/AV technologies.  San José is a pioneer in Urban Technology Demonstration a step ahead of many cities with this innovative work- live technology hub.   
 
2. Priority Safety Streets –  the City of San José is one of the major cities that have adopted 
Vision Zero.  Fifty percent of all  fatal crashes on San José's roadways occur on the City's 
14 identified Priority Safety Streets, which represent only three percent of the overall street system.   One fatality is too many and San José has committed to focus on technology and education to lower the number of crashes with a goal of eliminating 
roadway fatalities.  
 5 
 3. Priority Development /Urban Village Areas –  planning is underway in West San José that 
is expected to culminate in Urban Village Plans for three areas: Santana Row/Valley Fair 
Mall (high -level/high -traffic retail), Winchester Boulevard, and Stevens Creek Boulevard 
(both Winchester Boulevard and Stevens Creek feed I -880 and carry heavy traffic loads). 
Collectively, these three Urban Villages are known as the Tri -Villages. The Urban 
Village concept is a major strategy of San José’s General Plan Envision San José 2040 to 
transform strategically identified growth areas into higher -density, mixed- use, more 
urban districts that promote transit use, walkability, and bike -ability. The Urban Village 
concept is the growth strategy for future development in San José and Urban Village planning processes engage area community members, including property owners, community group representatives, developers, and other stakeholders.  
  
4. Downtown area of  San José -  A strong downtown is a hotbed of innovation, creativity 
and sustainability; downtown San José is no exception.  Thousands of residents work for large companies such as Adobe, Price Waterhouse Coopers and Oracle which converge with San José Stat e University and City Hall, and are serviced by extensive mobility 
options including bike sharing, light rail, bus routes and planned BRT and BART extensions. With significant infrastructure and investment in place, downtown presents 
incredible opportuniti es to advance the deployment of Smart City technology.  
Through its engaged populace, proximity to vast reserves of human capital in the private, public 
and academic sectors and commitment to innovation as demonstrated in the North San José 
Traffic Innovati on Zone, San José is prepared to accept and utilize grant funds to the fullest. As 
the “Capital of Silicon Valley”, San José is well positioned to work collaboratively with stakeholders across all sectors, implement new technologies, and set the standard f or Smart City 
deployment nationwide.
 
 
Program Management Approach  
The City of San José is looking to create a Smart City advisory board comprised of elected 
officials, city management and staff, public/private partnerships, community and other 
organizations.  This will ensure an established policy steering entity is driv en to offer advice  on 
policy, management and tactical/operational components. The program will ultimately be rolled out by a strong team comprised of experienced engineers, innovators and Smart City 
private/public partners.

 DEMOGRAPHICS AND CHARACTERISTICS  
According to the 2010 Census -designated place (CDP) population -  the City of San José had a 
population of 945,942 and an urban density (2010) of 56.8 percent within the San José UZA.  
San José has many characteristic that the U.S. Department of Transportation is looking for in a Smart City.  The City is the significant regional population center within the San José UZA and within the County of Santa Clara.  As the home to many of Silicon Valley's innovators, San José posses ses an engaged populace that is using cutting edge technology every day .  These residents 
are continuously looking for new ways to use technology to benefit their daily lives. 
 
The City of San José was founded on November 29, 1777 (as Pueblo de San José) a nd was the 
California's first civilian settlement -  San José the City was incorporated on March 27, 1850.  For 
more than 150  years San José was a small farming community, and the area in the mid -20th 
century contained some of the last undeveloped land near  San Francisco Bay. The City then 
began to experience rapid population growth, much of it coming from veterans returning home after World War II. San José continued its aggressive expansion during the 1950s and 1960s and 
today, San José encompasses 180.2 s quare miles and is located in a valley that is bounded by 
hillsides, baylands, and wetlands.  The rapid growth of the high- technology and electronics 
industries further accelerated the transition from an agricultural center to an  urbanized 
metropolitan area.  Today, only 0.4 percent of the City's jobs are related to farm industries -  the 
other 99.6 percent of jobs are divided between goods producing (20.2 percent) and service 
providing (79.4 percent).
 
According to the 2010 Census, the median age of the City's residents was 35 years with 24 
percent of the population under the age of 18.   This demographic supports the efforts of the Smart City Challenge to address transportation issues through the use of  technology and 
innovation.  Residents within these age groupings are already using technology and are using technology actively to provide opportunities in their daily lives to make choices on where they are going, how they will get there and how their choices are impacting the environment.  In addition to the usage of technology by the City's younger demographic residents over 35 are also highly engaged in  innovative work through their employment and also rely on technology.  This 
engagement and acceptance of the benefits of technology encompasses the goals of a Smart City.
 
The City of San José is a diverse community that is proud of the cultural and ethnic diversity of its population and workforce and the rich cultural identity of its many neighborhoods.  Within 
the City of San José there are more than 50 different languages spoken by its residents. People travel from all over the world to live and work in San José.  The richness of this cultural background feeds the innovative spirit of the City and bring s together people willing to 
experience new things and embrace new ideas.

The region’s concentration of highly skilled workers is one of its main competitive advantages as 
a technology and manufacturing cluster. High tech manufacturing provides local residents with well-paying job opportunities for a range of occupations and educational levels, while businesses 
of all sizes benefit from a large and diverse talent pool.   
 
SAN JOSÉ'S ALIGNMENT WITH SMART CITY GOALS  
 
Existing Transportation System  
The City is a close partner with a public transportation provider in the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA).  The VTA is headquartered in the City's transportation innovation zone (TIZ) and is an independent special district responsible for bus and light rail operations, congestion management, specific highway improvement projects and countywide transportation planning. As such, VTA is both an accessible transit provider and multi -modal 
transportation planning organization involved with trans it, highways, roadways, bikeways, and 
pedestrian facilities. VTA is also engaged in the development and construction of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and a new dynamic demonstration service (FLEX) that is an on- demand 8 
 connection service between regular transit s tops. The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) is also 
under construction within San José.  As a City within the nine -county Bay Area, San José also 
has access to a broader network of public transit that spans not only the nine -county region, but 
agencies that pr ovide service to Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties.  
 
 
Environment that is conductive to demonstrating strategies  
The City of San José encompasses many characteristics that makes it a perfect candidate to 
become a Smart City.  The rapid change in the City's economy base from agricultural to high-
technology shows the nimbleness of its residents to respond quickly to changing economies and industries.  The Silicon Valley is home to an incredible number of High Tech employers.  The top 5 major high tech employer s in San José are:
 
 
1. Cisco Systems  
2. eBay  
3. IBM  
4. Hitachi  
5. Adobe Systems  
There are also currently 18 firms locally developing technology around the use of DSRC technologies including Google, Toyota and BMW.  These companies would benefit from the 
designation of Sa n José as a Smart City.  The environment in and around San José is conducive 
to demonstrating the strategies proposed within this submittal.  The fast -paced innovative 
environment of Silicon Valley creates opportunities to move technology forward and to work 
with major high- tech companies to develop and implement shared goals.  The City has the 
advantage to be able to work with these ""local"" firms through partnerships that are already established. We have a track record in using our existing demonstration p olicy to partner with 
companies looking to implement and test new technology.
 
 
Continuity of committed leadership  
The City of San José has a history of progressive leadership and policy support for technology demonstration.  In 2008, San José was the first  city to create a ""Technology Demonstration 
Partnership Policy"" to enable companies to access City facilities and assets for pre- commercial 
technology demonstration.  The C ity’s Mayor, who has just completed his first year in office, has 
made innovation a primary focus of his term. As such, the Cities administration is following suit and have created a Civic Innovation Cabinet made up of top officials from throughout the city, including the Director of Transportation. City leadership also founded a nonprofit partner, 
Prospec tSV in 2013, to support emerging technology innovators, emphasizing advanced 
transportation, buildings, and renewable energy solutions.  The Mission of Prospec tSV is to 
provide critical infrastructure and affordable space for clean tech companies seeking technology demonstration and prototype opportunities –  providing commercial trials for innovators to test 
technology solutions and helping attract private capit al investment. 
 
 9 
 Commitment to making open data  
Our City has recently implemented an open data policy, platform and city manager lead team. As 
such, we have much of the hardware and infrastructure in place to take advantage of Smart City Challenge funding.   While other cities may need to use the majority of the funds to build up its 
technology spine San José will be able to leverage the funding to layer additional technology on its already expansive system.  The City's early commitment to technology allows it to jump start 
its program and meet the tight deadlines to implement and evaluate it programs and projects.
 
 
Further characteristics that makes San Jose a great candidate  
As stated previously, San José has been a leader in developing demonstration and pi lot programs 
through the creation of a Technology Demonstration Partnership Policy in 2008.  This policy has 
allowed San José to demonstrate the first public solar -powered electric vehicle charging station 
and 15 other clean tech projects.  
 
The challenge t hat the U.S. Department of Transportation has put forward is one that looks to 
mid-sized cities to develop innovative ways to address transportation challenges and demonstrate 
proven methods to address these issues and to create a ""playbook"" that other cit ies can utilize to 
put the demonstrated technologies in place.  San José in its approach is looking at ways to demonstrate innovation that will provide safety to its residents, create opportunities for mobility and will address climate change.  These goals  of the program are ones that San José shares with 
other cities that have similar characteristics including a downtown core, business/innovation center and surrounding neighborhoods.  The goal is to develop the playbook with technology chapters that can be used by other cities looking for specific types of smart technology, whether 
it is urban automation and connected vehicles, intelligent, sensor -based infrastructure, data 
analytics, and other areas of technology and Smart City elements; San José has the urban population, density and characteristics necessary to foster success.

Vision Element #8:  Smart Grid, Roadway Electrification, and Electric Vehicles  
Electric vehicle usage within San José is on the rise and there are now more electric vehicles in 
the City than  ever before. It has been reported that the county with the highest amount of electric 
vehicle ownership is Santa Clara County.  Recognizing this trend, the City made an early commitment to electric vehicle infrastructure and has installed electric vehicle stations across the 
City. These stations are located in parking garages and on- street locations. We are looking to 
extend this network by using Smart City solutions to integrate with current smart streetlight 
locations. Furthermore, we are looking towards  technology advances in wireless charging to see 
how that would integrate into our road network.
 
• Look at using current infrastructure assets to further roll out electric vehicle charging stations.  
• Review Smart streetlights for use for charging stations  
• Transit on demand, community 
electrical vehicles, green vehicles in 
TIZ and downtown  
• Utilize in city street environments, the 
streets can be used as wireless 
charging parking spaces  
• Investigate wireless charging opportunities and look tow ard 
automatic wireless charging of 
autonomous vehicles  
                                                                      Wireless Electric Vehicle Charging Stations

 Vision Element #9:  Connected, Involved Citizens  
The City of San José is committ ed to freely sharing as much information as possible. We 
recognize that information is a valuable resource and a strategic asset to the public.  Making 
information accessible, discoverable, and usable by the public can help fuel entrepreneurship, innovation, scientific discovery, and a more efficient government. Using visualizations as a data story is important to connect our citizens to the data so we will be looking at creating useful data 
dashboards and information sources for our community. 
 
• Open data and open analytics/visualizations  
• Build real -time data information into smart kiosks at bus stops  
• Allowing access for developers to create and integrate smart phone applications. Some 
examples include:  
o access to traffic, schedule and congestion information  
o social media applications using parking/traffic data  
  18 
 • Real time information, some requested 
information points are outlined 
o air quality data  
o traffic and speed data 
o parking data  
o transit bus fleet locations  
 
 
 
Vision Element #10:  Architecture and Standards  
Our current infrastructure architecture is based on open standards and our strategic vision is to 
ensure implementations are interoperable across other environments. The City is broad with many partners operating within it and logistically, San J osé is in close proximity to many other 
cities so this standards based approach is even more important as we extend and expand our 
transportation infrastructure. We will ensure these standards continue by:
 
• Use of ITS Nation Architecture and supporting standards  
• Utilize the SET -IT tool for deployments  
• For mobility applications, use of TMDD at center, then NTCIP to interface and SAE 
J2735 and J2945/x at the field element level  
• Project architecture conformable to enterprise, physical and communications archi tecture 
defined in CVRIA  
• Leverage vendors knowledge and participation of over -the-air standards and technologies 
in all relevant sectors –  transportation, automotive, telecommunications –  to bring high 
performing interface solutions pertinent to into the project and the CVRIA architecture  
 
 
Vision Element #11:  Low -Cost, Secure, and Resilient Information and Communications 
Technology (ICT)  
The City currently owns an extensive fiber network which allows for the ability to rapidly deploy 
communication equipm ent. There is a citywide monitoring system in place to ensure equipment 
and connectivity is maintained without interruption and the City is working on a request for proposal (RFP) for a smart alerting system that will be incorporated into this program. The  City 
would be able to utilize this asset to:
 
• Leverage the existing Fiber -City network 
• Use existing and opportunistic WI -FI access points  
• Ensure current Smart City infrastructure is leveraged such as the smart LED streetlights  
• Implement DSRC secured authe ntication for trusted devices  
19 
 • Leverage cloud based services for elastic scalability and cost efficiency  
• Provide open data without providing access to secure process control networks or PII 
data 
 
 
Vision Element #12:  Smart Land Use  
The City is committed to Smart Land Use with the development of its Envision 2040 General Plan.  San Jose recognizes that in order to provide the needed transportation services for its growing population there needs to be new innovative ways to address the se issues.  San Jose is 
focusing on the development of Urban Villages that will benefit from innovative approaches to transportation including modal options, advanced traffic management and open data. Some ideas 
include:  
• Use of smart software to identify dead traffic zones, which will allow planners to 
rejuvenate and re- invent neighborhoods  
• Connect different aspects (businesses) i.e. in a city stadium or airports  
• Implement eco -friendly last mile solutions, such as: bike -share, electric bikes, scooters, 
narrow vehicles or segways  
• Bicycle safe lanes with buffers and other improvements to encourage more bike use  
• Re-using existing transportation for multi -purpose such as:  
o Electrifying wireless charging parking space  
o Installing sensors for ridership analytics and pick up  
o Enabling access to city data for all citizens  
o More shared vehicles: fewer garages, more living space

INFRASTRUCTURE  
Arterial miles  – There are 314 centerline miles of arterials within the City of San José.  
Freeway miles  – There are 63.8 centerline miles of Federal interstates and State highways in San 
José.  
Transit services  
Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA)  
Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) is an independent special district that 
provides  sustainable, accessible, community -focused transportation options that are innovative, 
environmentally responsible, and promote the vitality of our region. VTA provides bus, light rail, and paratransit services, as well as participates as a funding partner in regional rail service including Caltrain, Capital Corridor, and the Altamont Corridor Express. As the county’s congestion management agency, VTA is responsible for countywide transportation planning, including congestion management, design and construction of specific highway, pedestrian, and bicycle improvement projects, as well as promotion of transit oriented development. VTA provides these services throughout the county.  VTA continually builds partnerships to deliver 
transportation solutions that meet the evolving mobility needs of Santa Clara County.  
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)  
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) is a rapid transit system serving the San Francisco Bay Area. 
The heavy -rail public transit and subway system connects San Francisco with ci ties in the East 
Bay and suburbs in northern San Mateo County. BART's rapid transit system operates five routes on 104 miles (167 km) of line, with 44 stations in four counties. With an average of 422,490 weekday passengers, 211,288 Saturday passengers, an d 158,855 Sunday passengers in 
September 2014, [ 7] BART is the fifth -busiest heavy rail rapid transit system in the United States.  
BART is operated by the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District, a special -purpose 
transit district that was formed in 1957 to cover San Francisco, Alameda County, and Contra Costa County. The acronym is almost universally pronounced like the name ""Bart"" rather than 
spelled out.  
Caltrain  
Caltrain provides inter - and intra -county commuter rail service along the San Francisc o 
Peninsula, including San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties. The current weekday Caltrain operating schedule is comprised of a mix of 92 express (Baby Bullet), limited, and local trains. Caltrain operates 36 trains on Saturday and 32 on Sunda y, with service primarily 
composed of local trains, with two Baby Bullet trains in each direction per day.  
Altamont Corridor Express (ACE)  23 
 The Altamont Corridor Express (ACE) provides service from the city of Stockton to Santa Clara 
County.  It runs a dist ance of approximately 85 miles from Stockton through Alameda County 
into San José in Santa Clara County.  
Capital Corridor Inter -City Rail  
The Capitol Corridor is an intercity passenger train system that provides a convenient alternative to traveling along the congested I -80, I-680 and I -880 freeways by operating fast, reliable and 
affordable intercity rail service to 16 stations in 8 Northern California counties: Placer, Sacramento, Yolo, Solano, Contra Costa, Alameda, San Francisco, and Santa Clara, a 170 -mile 
rail corridor. An extensive, dedicated motor coach  network provides bus connections to serve the 
second -largest urban service area in the Western United States.  
Shared -Use Mobility Services  
Shared -use mobility comprises transportation services that are shared among users, including 
traditional public transit; taxis and limos; bike sharing ; car sharing  (round- trip, one -way, and 
personal vehicle sharing); ridesharing (car -pooling, van- pooling);  ride-sourcing; scooter sharing; 
shuttle services; neighborhood jitneys; and commercial delivery vehicles providing flexible goods movement.  San José has responded to the call for shared- use mobility by significantly 
expanding its bike network, fostering the development of bike - and car -sharing services, 
collaborating with the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) on transit improvements, adopting a Vision Zero (no traffic fatalities or serious injuries) policy and plan, and preparing to roll out a community- based social marketing (CBSM) program to encourage 
residents and employees to use “green” commute options rather than drive alone. But, smart technology, applied effectively, could help make even greater gains. San José is working with a number of public agencies, non- profits, and private organizations to expand the mobility options 
available to those who live and work in this area.
 
City Bike Fleet  – City bicycle program that provides bicycle to use to go to meetings and for 
other city trips.  
Bay Area Regional Bike Share Program  – 24/7 shared bicycles available throughout the region at 
key transportation locations and ride generators.  
Eco Pass  - The Eco Pass provides free access to eligible City employees to VTA's bus and light 
rail services.  
TDM Pilot Program - Developing community- based social marketing to encourage residents and 
employees to use green transportation options.  
Carpooling - Carpool Buddy program allows fellow CSJ employees to connect and set up 
carpools at their own convenience.  511.org also supports City employees and resident carpool 
options.  
Car sharing - San José adopted a car share parking pilot program in 2012 to support the growth 
and long -term success of car sharing in the City.  The pilot has enabled Zipcar to expand its  
operation in San José from an initial 12 cars to 35.  24 
 Information and Communication Technology (ICT)   
A strong Information and Communication Technology infrastructure is required to create and 
deploy a strong Intelligent Transportation System.  Many of the  traditional forms of data 
collection are currently in use in U.S. cities.  These include sensors, induction loops, and cameras among others.  This data is then processed analyzed and processed in traffic control centers.  The City of San José currently ut ilizes information that it receives and processes it through its Traffic 
Incident Management Center (TIMC).
 
It is envisioned that this information, among others currently under consideration, will be shared 
to academia and industry partners to promote and support mobility, urban automation, and 
various elements of the sharing economy.  A current example of an ICT application already taking place in San José is the City's Cooperative agreement with BMW to study and explore 
how vehicle drivers can time the gr een light of an approaching signalized intersection.
 
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)  
Eight years ago, San José embarked on an ambitious, $20 million grant effort to modernize its 
legacy, serial based traffic signal infrastructure into a state -of-the art, IP based transportation 
system. The foundation of this implementation is a robust field communications network made up of a mixture of hardware technologies, transport mediums, and network architectures. Over 70 miles of fiber optic cabli ng are installed in three physically separated rings, providing the 
highest level of redundancy to traffic signal communication and the various transportation applications and services. Six hubs strategically located along the fiber rings serve as aggregat ion 
points for more than 650 DSL based Ethernet switches that leverage the City’s existing inventory of 150 miles of SIC cabling. Additionally, over 400 high- speed, wireless broadband Ethernet 
radios are installed in point -to-point and point -to-multipoint configurations to address the last 
mile connection requirement for hard to reach signalized intersections. The design of a fiber optic trunk system with aggregated hub locations and establishment of fiber optic hub to hub 
redundancy provides a highly robus t fault tolerant network with high bandwidth throughput.
 
The City’s current mix of standard ITS hardware and networking protocols has facilitated the use 
of industry standard network management system which ITS staff routinely uses to monitor the network’s  health. This exercise has resulted in improved response times in addressing 
communication faults, improved signal operations by enabling staff to be more responsive to real-time traffic conditions, and allowed for timely repair and restoration of optimal intersection 
operations. In addition to utilizing industry standard networking equipment in its traffic communication network, San José has adopted industry standard traffic signal equipment, such as 2070ATC controllers at more than its 930 signalized inte rsections, NEMA TS1/TS2 and 
Caltrans 332 cabinets, and NTCIP protocols for central based communications between field controllers and the ATMS. To improve traffic surveillance, the City has deployed CCTV cameras at over 240 locations over its existing IP -based communications network, allowing staff 
to effectively monitor live traffic conditions and adjust signal timing if required to accommodate demand. With the primary aim of improving traffic flow and reducing vehicle emissions, San José is an ardent supporter of transit signal priority and adaptive signal control. Transit signal 25 
 priority is deployed at 77 light rail signalized intersections and over 50 intersections along two of 
the VTA’s most heavily utilized express bus lines. In 2011, San José successf ully implemented 
adaptive traffic signal control at 35 signalized intersections, spread throughout six heavily 
congested corridors.  
Building on the experience and knowledge gained from this and other infrastructure 
improvement projects, San José saw unique  opportunities to be an early adopter of Smart City 
technologies, such as smart LED streetlights, parking guidance and dynamic message signs, and smart parking meters. One third of the 62,000 streetlights have been converted to LED to date, with plans to c omplete the total conversion by 2020. To ensure positive travel experience to 
downtown events, a network of eight dynamic message signs and 13 of parking guidance signs are utilized to provide timely and useful information of available parking, traffic conditions, 
detours, etc.
 
At the heart of this operation is a second generation, state -of-the-art, traffic management center 
recently opened in March 2015. Located at City Hall, it was designed to better integrate 
operations of city traffic, roadway safety and maintenance services, and to better coordinate regional transportation services, including county- wide transit operations. This federally funded 
facility enables engineering staff to actively monitor traffic flow conditions, optimize traffic signal opera tions, minimize travel delays resulting from event and incident traffic, as well as 
identify and facilitate timely repair of traffic signal system malfunctions. Currently, roadway system performance capabilities are being implemented to allow staff to easi ly identify unusual 
conditions and events that may have potential to cause travel delays and system malfunctions.
 
The City's infrastructure includes:  
• 932 traffic signals  
• 453 surveillance cameras (Fixed, PTZ, Embedded ) at 241 intersections  
• 447 video image detection system (VIDS) cameras @ 150 intersections  
• 8 Changeable message signs (CMS)  
• 61 flashing beacons / RRFB’s (41 solar)  
• 66 Speed radar signs (20 solar) 88 related Wireless Radios  
• 167 International protocol (IP) video encoders  
• 650 Ethernet over copper network switches  
• 6 Hub Ethernet fiber switches  
• 50 Ethernet wireless radios Downtown  Wi-Fi 
• 402 wireless Ethernet radios for signal communications  
• 21 EMTRAC bus priority units (San Carlos -Stevens Creek)  
• 6 communication poles/equipment  
• 41,982 Traffic signals light emitting diodes (LED)  
• 5,785 countdown LED peds  
• 86 miles of fiber  
• 146 miles of interconnect cable  
• 215 Streetlight Segment Controllers (total by end of FY 14 -15) 26 
  
DATA 
San José’s current data landscape is robust, but we also recognize that growth and innovation—
particularly in the areas of transportation and civic technology—will allow the City to collect even larger quantities of real -time information.  With this in min d, the City has begun laying the 
groundwork to make use of this information through a variety of interrelated Smart City and 
civic innovation initiatives related to data collection, sharing, and analytics.    
 
In 2015, at the request of the City Manager, t he City conducted a comprehensive, citywide 
inventory of all existing datasets as part of our on- going Open Data Initiative.  With over 600 
datasets identified to date, this effort has resulted in a vastly improved understanding of our 
information assets, which we have already begun using to improve service delivery and streamline the flow of information across agencies and to the public.  Transportation in particular will benefit tremendously from this effort.  In DOT alone, over 50 datasets have been identified, many of which will be made publicly available on the City of San José’s Open Data Portal, allowing residents, visitors, and employees unfettered access to the same information management uses for internal decision making.  City managers and frontli ne staff will soon be 
operating with maximum access to citywide information resources regardless of which agency “owns” and maintains a given dataset.  In the first quarter of 2016, San José will codify its Open Data Policy, either through administrative a ction or City Council vote, which will solidify its 
commitment to the core principles of open data and information sharing.  This will ensure opportunities for innovation are executed efficiently and appropriately and community feedback is integrated thoroughly into the City’s vision of a highly efficient, safe and reliable, multi -modal 
transportation network. 
 
As the “Capital of Silicon Valley,” San José has a litany of opportunities to collaborate with our community of technology- based businesses, non- profits and “civic hacktivists”, along with our 
regional transportation partners and neighboring jurisdictions, to advance Smart City technologies in support of our broader transportation goals.  As part of our Vision Zero traffic safety initiative, the City has already begun leveraging the expertise of its internal Data Analytics Team and the non- profit organization DataKind, a data -science firm supporting Vision Zero 
efforts in cities across the United States, to enhance public safety through mitigating traf fic 
fatalities and severe injuries for pedestrians, motorists, and cyclists.  On the transportation innovation front, San José is engaging with a local research institution as part of the nationwide MetroLab Network to identify opportunities for the implem entation of Smart City projects 
related to sensor technologies and big data analytics.  These are the first of many cross -cutting 
partnerships the City plans to cultivate, catalyzing our Smart City and innovation vision.   
 
Given its early commitment to de veloping cross -cutting partnerships, the City is well positioned 
to execute timely data sharing agreements to support our Smart City endeavors.  The San José Open Data Policy explicitly states that data owned and maintained by the City is open by default, barring security or privacy concerns.  Where privacy concerns and security risks are a factor, our 27 
 current collaborative partnerships will inform the processes by which we share sensitive data.   
Implementation of this policy in early 2016 will help facili tate a seamless flow of information to 
our partners.  Indeed, the City has already begun sharing information and has seen significant improvements in this area.  DataKind has been given complete access to the DOT collision database, which tracks all data coming out of the San José Police Department’s traffic collision reports, for example.  In support of our MetroLab Network partnership, the City plans to share data collected from sensors placed throughout the City.  Data collected from our new LED “smart” streetlights, which record energy use, is also likely to be shared as part of our ongoing, 
citywide Smart City vision. 
 
 
Standards, Architectures, and Certification Processes for 
ITS and Connected Vehicle Based Technologies  
The City will leverage our partn ership with our vendors to participate in and understand the 
standards and certifications needed from around the world –  with particular focus of IEEE 
802.11, IEEE 1609 WG, SAE DSRC TC –  to ensure that our National Architecture - and CVRIA -
compliant and doc umented architectures are or can be compliant to existing and proposed 
standards. For proposed standards, we will ensure that in partnership with our vendors we use 
knowledge and participation in standards bodies to advocate for and develop standards as 
appropriate.  
We will ask our vendors to assist in translating their understanding of the capabilities and gaps of 
incipient Connected Vehicle certifications to focus and mature certifications of Smart City 
applications.  
We will seek partnership and guidance with vendors that have leadership positions in some of 
the standards development and certification. This would position us well to collaborate with the vendor in all aspects of the familiar standards and certification ecosystem to the benefit of our propos ed project approach and to the benefit of our Connected Vehicle and Smart Cities 
deployments.
 
We will ask our chosen vendors to use the SET -IT tool and also contribute to the editorial 
content of emerging standards. Additionally,  a “Standards and Architecture” publication will be created to enable understanding and replication of the Smart Cities applications as well as current 
and anticipated standards to enable deployment and interoperability.
 
 
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES  
Service delivery goals and metr ics will be tracked using the strategic goals set out in the 
Transportation Service Delivery Framework. Some examples include:

Furthermore  - discussions with technology partners will set highly measurable goals to ensure 
the implementation is carry out on time, measured and analyzed. Results will be used to adjust 
and improve the operations. Comparison will be calculated to provide the most meaningful 
collation.  
 
PROJECT CAPACITY AND COMMITMENT  
San José’s Office of Economic Development is committed to providing an integrated, solutions 
based approach to business assistance that creates a foundation for entrepreneurs and companies 
to develop new ideas and foster economic opportunities for generations to come.  
We are committed to driving a vital and competitive economy that increases prosperity and 
quality of life for our residents and businesses. Our mission is to catalyze job creation, private  
investment, revenue generation, and talent attraction and development.  
As the largest city in the Bay Area, a growing population of young professionals, expert technologists and experienced managers call San José home. You will have the advantage of 
attracting a globally diverse workforce by locating in San José.
 
City Capacity for Implementation: San José has been in the fore front of technology 
implementation. Situated in the heart of Silicon Valley, San José has been partnering with technology leaders to transform the City into a Smart City, serving our large diverse population 
and improving the quality of life for the under privileged. 
 29 
 Our commitment to innovation has led to having a great technical base to implement Smart City 
solutions. Our Transporta tion Innovation Zone coupled with Prospect Silicon Valley gives us an 
opportunity to partner with interested vendors to lab test Smart City technology and then deploy 
rapidly in a real world scenario.  
We not only have the technological knowhow and innovati ve culture to take on the smart 
transportation implementation, but the passion to be the leader in autonomous vehicles and road 
electrification. We have already implemented many advanced and innovative solutions within 
the City and are passionate about mov ing forward with more implementations.  
 
OPPORTUNITIES  
The City will work closely with its partners to leverage any Federal dollars received from the 
Federal Government for the Smart City Challenge.  As the Capital of Silicon Valley, San José has a unique opportunity to take advantage of both public and privat e leveraging opportunities. 
There is a long history supporting innovation and incubation, going back over more than 15 years. For example, San José helped create and fund four different incubators that were highly 
successful and each remained operation for  between 10 -15 years.   
Working in partnership with PROSPECT SV, the City would be able to leverage Federal funding by having access to the benefits that PROSPECT SV generates, such as:
 
• Provide a public commercial facility that will facilitate prototype de velopment, testing 
and demonstration of emerging solar, clean transportation, energy efficiency, smart grid, 
storage and other clean technologies in Silicon Valley.  
• Increase commercialization of grant -funded applied research in clean technologies 
through partnerships with universities, government agencies and research labs in order to 
help meet City, State and National environmental priorities.  
According to conversations with Governor Jerry Brown's office, the Governor is supportive of 
all California cities  that submit an application to USDOT's Smart City Challenge and that for 
every $1 invested by the Federal Government, the State will more than double the Federal 
investment with  State funding.  
The City will also work with the many educational institutions locally and those local private companies already advancing work in these fields.

RE: ""Beyond Traffic: The Smart City Challenge"" 
Dear Ms. Tarpgaard and Selection Committee Members: 
Never has there been a more amazing time in our history to implement emerging technologies that will 
forever change how we move about communities. The Smart City Challenge is a pivotal step in this 
change and the City of Lincoln is eager to share with you our vision. Our project will provide 
increased connectivity to underserved populations, provide transp01iation education oppo rtunities, and 
spark new trends in our many high tech private sector startup companies. 
Lincoln is poised to accept the Smart City challenge and is in a perfect position to leverage two of our 
technology projects already underway. Our recently announced fiber-to-the-home public/private 
partnership will bring high speed broadband to every citizen, and Gigabit connections to every traffic 
signal and public building facility. Our ""Green Light Lincoln"" project will modernize our entire traffic 
system, implementing the newest software, hardware, and management center in America this year. 
These two projects provide a foundation on which we plan to build our Smart City project, and will 
allow us to start work immediately. 
The City of Lincoln has a bold and innovative management team and we are fully committed to the 
successful, on time completion of this project. And, we take this challenge very seriously as we 
understand that this is more than a demonstration project -it is opportunity for our city to change 
thinking, improve our climate, and enhance quality of life. 
Thank you again for this unique funding opportunity. We look forward to sharing more of our ideas 
with you during the next round of solicitation. 
Sincerely, _ 
d.���
Chris Beutler 
Mayor of Lincoln 1
CITY OF LINCOLN1Imagine a city offering the greatest quality of life. A capital city with a strong economy, 
a vibrant downtown, and top notch schools at all levels. Imagine a city full of people with optimism, and a spirit of innovation and discovery. People of multiple ethnic and economic backgrounds – caring, volunteering, and fostering a sense of community 
pride. 
Imagine a city in the middle of the U.S., with growing mobility challenges, yet a clear 
directive on urban growth policy. A city with a renewed focus on transportation and technology that is facing the challenges of growth head on. A city with a large student population, feeding the technology startups that are expanding the “silicon prairie” to help address this growth. 
Imagine a city on the cusp of beltway construction around 
its perimeter, bringing additional commerce to the largest freight corridor in America. A city that has so far dodged the need for such freeways bisecting its community center and displacing people. A community where neighborhoods tie to other neighborhoods that tie to mixed use development. This is Lincoln. This is a great City. 
We know that a strong transportation network integrated 
across all modes that serves everyone is a vital key to maintaining our desirable community. Through the years, we maintain our roads and bridges, and we’ve built new roads and bridges. We are now at a point where we must prioritize technology to improve mobility. We must implement and operate the next generation of our system to be consistent with the reality of funding and the desires of the end user. We have work to do. We are ready.
To address the continued transportation challenges of the future and better manage 
existing mobility, the City of Lincoln has proposed bold yet attainable components of a demonstration project. We will leverage our current and on-going transportation technology assets to accomplish the following vision elements ahead of schedule: 
•Implement a fully autonomous, electric vehicle transit enhancement to our currentsystem that will result in a 20% reduction of vehicle trips city wide.
•Deploy additional city wide non-intrusive sensors and communications hardware tofacilitate connected vehicle applications and proactive traffic management.
Secretary Foxx & Mayor BeutlerLINCOLN’S 
VISION 12
CITY OF LINCOLN•Collection, analysis, and documentation of data across the traffic management
system to allow for performance measurement and application development bythe private sector in coordination with our many partners and stakeholders.
•Robust public education regarding these smart transportation initiatives, includinga primary focus within our after school programs serving under-representedpopulations and transportation technology programs at our career academies.
These items will be rolled into the delivery of an unprecedented demonstration project that can be documented and later applied to other mid-sized cities across the United States. Our current environment in Lincoln (as described in later sections) will make this 
a reality. The results of this effort will be more than just a demonstration project for the 
City of Lincoln. This initiative will produce citizen and industry buy-in, and will change the transportation landscape in Lincoln, and elsewhere, forever. This project will address ALL three of the high-level anticipated outcomes as identified in the solicitation:
VISION CHALLENGES
The challenges are real. Whether nationally or locally in Lincoln, these primary outcomes must be addressed as we build and manage our future city.

        Safety 2.Enhance
        Mobility 3.Address   
        Climate Change
The City of Lincoln transportation network is impacted by approximately 
7,500 crashes annually, resulting in a socioeconomic loss to the community of nearly $300,000,000 each year. In addition, the amount of bicycle related crashes has been on a steep increase in recent history, indicating the improved mode share of bicycle activity has outpaced our implementation of safe improvements.
The current City of Lincoln transit system struggles to provide “off hour” 
operations including abbreviated Saturday service and no Sunday service. In addition, the fixed route nature of the system can leave those with limited mobility at a disadvantage to reach certain stops. Lincoln has increasing poverty levels within neighborhoods adjacent to the Central Business District, furthering the need for enhanced transportation services that are affordable and efficient. 
Continued greenhouse gas emissions due to idling and inefficient vehicle 
travel continues to result in a real monetary loss and also impacts the climate in aggregate. Achieving low-carbon cities will require giving people incentives to make different choices about how they live, work and travel. There is a need to partner with key stakeholders to reinvent how services are delivered, save energy, and build the next generation of sustainable transit and traffic management systems.3
CITY OF LINCOLNImproving the transportation network to produce solutions that mitigate these 
challenges and provide the desired outcomes can be  achieved. It can be  demonstrated 
to the public. It will result  in a game changer for the citizens of Lincoln and the USDOT.
VISION APPROACH
The City of Lincoln vision for the Smart City Challenge will be focused into attainable 
project components that leverage our current and continued focus on the use of 
technology for major transformation of our system. It will educate and build consensus, 
boost transportation research and development, and level the playing field amongst 
all citizens in regards to transportation accessibility. The project vision elements are 
illustrated in Figure 1 , and are further described on the following pages.

  1. LINC
Our Smart City Lincoln vision will implement a robust enhancement to our existing 
transit system. In fact – it will become the majority carrier of our ridership. We will 
deploy and integrate LINC (Lincoln Independent Navigational Carriers) in a phased 
implementation city wide with a bold but reachable goal of reducing 20% of existing 
vehicle trips and parking needs. 4
CITY OF LINCOLN
 Figure 2 –  LINC Transit systemThe LINC system will include two vehicle types – 1) a shuttle seating 8 passengers 
that will provide service to the immediate Central Business District, and 2) standard 
passenger cars for city wide service. These vehicles will have the following 
characteristics: 
• Autonomous (driver-less) 
• Electrically Powered (battery)
• Connected (to each other, and the traffic signal system)
The LINC system will work based upon user requested information via typical smart 
device applications. Efficiencies in route designation will 
be provided based upon fastest path data, and nearby 
user requests (ride-sharing). 
 The LINC system will provide for exponential growth in 
ridership amongst all citizens. As more users become 
comfortable with the ease of use and economic value of 
the system, in addition to wide ranging education and 
marketing of its benefits, the results will be dramatic 
and far reaching. This demonstration project and 
its documented value in enhancing safety, mobility, 
and climate change will lead to an even larger scale 
deployment. More detailed project initiatives for the 
LINC system include:
• Allowing existing transit service to focus solely on 
fixed route, high ridership corridors between major 
trip generators, and additional special use service.
• Connectivity of the vehicles to one another, and 
the traffic signal system, will allow for incredible 
efficiencies, safety, and vehicle management. 
5
CITY OF LINCOLN• Transit signal priority will be deployed city wide on both LINC and the thirty (30) 
compressed natural gas (CNG) buses that remain on the existing system fleet.
• Mail and package delivery demonstration  will be included for a number of test 
vehicles at defined private carrier parcel stops and the downtown U.S. Postal 
Service facility.
• In vehicle, looping video and 
interactive education materials 
will be presented and displayed 
so that the riders are able to 
learn even more about the 
LINC system, their personal 
contributions to benefits of the 
program, and other USDOT 
transportation technology 
initiatives.
• Major safety enhancements for 
moving downtown pedestrians 
during special events such as at the Pinnacle Bank Arena, and during UNL home 
football game days which bring over 100,000 spectators interacting with traffic  
crossing two major arterials in a 6-block area.
 
In addition to just this sample list of obvious and impactful components of the LINC 
system, a major focus will be on the change in vehicle power. Implementation of 
additional electric vehicle charging stations will be completed throughout Lincoln at 
multiple, strategic locations that are public property 
operated by City of Lincoln. In partnership with our 
own Lincoln Electric System (LES), dozens of these 
aggregated sites will be constructed to provide 
ample bandwidth for the 600-plus autonomous, 
connected vehicles .

CITY OF LINCOLN
Train Delays in LincolnWith a current focus already on alternative fuels and clean energy through our existing 
CNG powered bus fleet, this will be yet another community enhancement that can be 
documented with stakeholders. These sites will be used to recharge the new fleet of 
vehicles during non-peak electric usage  periods. In addition, adjacent use recharging 
infrastructure will be completed by the City to allow for private citizen charging access 
at relevant locations.
 2. SENSORS
To complement the LINC project component, and deliver additional Smart City 
capabilities, a major deployment of non-intrusive sensors and dynamic short range 
communications (DSRC) equipment will be made at every signalized intersection. For 
this component of our project vision, the City of Lincoln will leverage its already robust 
network of camera detection and Bluetooth/Wi-Fi sensors to obtain additional vehicle 
data and travel characteristics. The sensors will be tied to existing signal infrastructure 
and routed to the cabinet equipment. Data will be brought back to the Operations 
Center over the expansive Gigabit fiber connections at field cabinet locations. 
Non-Intrusive Vehicle Sensors
Supplemental data collection systems via sensors will gather not only traffic data, but 
also other system data impacting mobility. An example of one major ancillary system 
is the many at-grade railroad crossings that impact the City of Lincoln transportation 
network. The busiest railway 
corridor in the world  makes its 
way through the state of Nebraska. 
Both the BNSF and Union Pacific 
Railroads have facilities that traverse 
through Lincoln. Thus, the need 
for smart railroad crossings and 
sensors that can provide valuable 
information for impending train 
delays and alternate routing are 
critical. 7
CITY OF LINCOLNA robust system of DSRC units will 
also be installed at signal locations to 
provide valuable Vehicle-to-Infrastructure 
(V2I) communications capabilities. The 
V2I setup will allow the signal system 
to communicate with all LINC system 
vehicles and other private vehicles with 
capable on board equipment. The 
infrastructure will inform riders and drivers 
of traffic conditions, work zones, weather, 
and potholes. Enhanced signal timing and 
operational efficiencies can also be better 
managed. 
In addition to vehicle applications, Lincoln will also implement test equipment for new 
bicycle facilities. The “N Street Cycle Track” has just opened and was recently awarded 
a #4 ranking of America’s 10 Best New Bike Lanes 2015!  In addition to the existing 
wireless magnetic bicycle sensors along the track, what a great time to implement new 
bicycle-to-vehicle communications for the LINC vehicles (among others) to gather more 
data and improve safety.

FACT!
“20 Billion connected 
devices are expected by 
the year 2020.” 3. DATA
So what to do with all this data? The third project 
component will be focused on massive data 
aggregation, data sharing, analytics , reporting, 
and detailed performance measurement. There 
will no doubt be a wealth of data. And with all this 
data and connectivity comes possibility. Raw data 
sets will be summarized and funneled through 
the cities new advanced traffic management 
software (ATMS), further enriching the capability 
to improve and automate signal coordination plans, transit signal priority for the LINC 
system, and active traffic management of problem areas on the network. 
Open source data for the sharing economy  can 
only help to spur entrepreneurial solutions and 
new applications for further improving mobility for 
all users. Creating an environment of safe, open 
data sharing will provide additional educational 
and economic opportunities. Next generation 
transportation industry startups will focus 
additional energy to develop applications for 
mobility on demand.
A connection to real-time data from the traffic 
management system will allow our partner 
stakeholders, private industry, and the public 
at large to benefit from improved research and 
development capabilities. In addition, as part 
of the large scale data gathering and analyses, relevant reporting and performance 
measurement will be documented for the LINC system impacts, and many other traffic 
operational, safety, and environmental benefits. 
Through the course of the Lincoln demonstration project this compelling data can be 
utilized to further market the improved quality of life benefits realized through better 
mobility for all users and the reduction of inefficient vehicle trips.
 4. EDUCATION
The final project component identified for the Lincoln Vision is what really helps the 
future happen today. It is the focused and widespread education of these Smart City 
transportation technologies and concepts to the end users. It is vital to educate users 
of all ages and backgrounds on the importance of getting beyond traffic , and 
getting there soon. If we are to make fundamental changes in living habits and how we 
use transportation, education and consensus amongst our coworkers, neighbors, 
friends, and children is key.  Without motivation, there is no change. 9
CITY OF LINCOLNIt has been identified that much of the 
future employment opportunities in the 
transportation field will be “operations 
focused.” The transportation industry 
needs talented operators and 
individuals who are excited to take 
smart transportation technologies to 
the next level. Proper training and 
career path development in many of 
the transportation sector employment 
opportunities will be crucial to advance 
modern mobility.
Through our partnerships with local 
education leaders and research faculty, a swift, yet formal program will be rolled out 
into our local schools – with initial focus on those schools serving under-represented 
populations. In addition, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Nebraska Transportation 
Center will support the Smart City 
Challenge through continued 
education in the “After School 
Program.” This program is for age 
K-12 students and is uniquely geared 
towards building a diverse base 
of transportation professionals  to 
ensure sustainable transportation 
infrastructure for future generations. 
And finally, the Career Academy - a 
joint venture between Lincoln Public 
Schools and Southeast Community College (SCC) - will be utilized to further the 
knowledge base of transportation technologies amongst those wishing to pursue a 
career in the industry.

CITY OF LINCOLNWHY
LINCOLN?
The City of Lincoln is an ideal match for the Smart City Challenge.  Our population 
demographics and other characteristics as defined in the USDOT solicitation favor 
Lincoln as great testbed in the middle of America.  See Table 1 below for a description 
of how we compare:

innovation
LINCOLNLincoln has existing open GIS, ITS, and traffic data sources for consumption 
by the public, other agency stakeholders, and research partners211
CITY OF LINCOLNAs illustrated on the previous page, Lincoln satisfies ALL criteria.  In addition, our 
environment in the Midwest makes us a perfect demonstration location.  Lincoln has 
weather patterns ranging from some of the hottest to some of the coldest in the nation.  
If a project can work here, it can work anywhere!  This is a key factor when testing new 
technologies such as electrical charging stations, roadway sensors, and communications 
equipment.  Whether or not products are properly outdoor rated (NEMA TS2 etc.) we 
can put them through the paces by simply letting Mother Nature work.
Lincoln also has similar and possibly more unique 
characteristics than our peer cities when evaluating 
information provided in the USDOT report Beyond Traffic 
2045, Trends and Choices .  As illustrated in the growth 
map that was included in the report, Lincoln and Lancaster 
County Nebraska is one of the highest growth areas in the 
entire Midwest.
  
Lincoln is “One Community.” This moniker is the main 
aspect of the long term vision for the community in 
its Comprehensive Plan as both a current reality and 
as a future aspiration. Over 90% of Lancaster County’s 
population and growth occurs within the city limits of 
Lincoln, and consistent goals and policies are shared 
throughout the community. There are no competing 
suburbs to divide the benefits of this growing city. IOWA

Lincoln Growth12
CITY OF LINCOLNInstead, Lincoln prospers by having single, top performing public school district that 
serves all the residents of the city. Longstanding policies of phasing urban growth and 
appropriately timed public infrastructure improvements help Lincoln provide urban 
services and utilities efficiently. This not only allows Lincoln to prosper, but it also helps 
maintain an “edge” between urban and rural land uses in Lancaster County. Lincoln 
is committed to remain a unified community through these policies and thus is 
positioned to move forward as a leading 21st Century city. 
As One Community, the City of Lincoln has grown in a more compact and contiguous 
manner than peer cities in the region. Lincoln’s population density of 2,899 persons 
per square mile benefits from an increase in infill development in the Downtown area 
over the past several years. Over a quarter of all new residential development 
has occurred in the Downtown area during the past six years. Such recent trends 
lead to expectations that population density in the older core areas of Lincoln will 
increase steadily.  Similarly, employment densities are also trending upwards with major 
expansions and increased concentrations in the Downtown area. All of this points to a 
more efficient and productive future for Lincoln. Continued emphasis on policies that 
support a more efficient city are in place to achieve such a future.
The City of Lincoln is also somewhat unique in the transportation challenges we face 
due to being in the confluence of the large-scale and impactful freight corridors that 
travel through our community.  With Interstate 80 (I-80) traversing the north side of 
our community, U.S. Hwy 77 on the west, a new South Beltway being readied for 
construction, and NE Hwy 2 providing connectivity to I-29 and Kansas City to the south, 
we lie along one of the largest trucking corridors in America.  In addition, due to the 
presence of a major confluence of BNSF and Union Pacific Railroad lines in this end of 
our state, we also fight mobility issues with the busiest rail lines in the world . 
A map on the following page depicts the freight flows in America for 2010.
City of Lincoln skyline at night13
CITY OF LINCOLNThese factors, along with the following list of “Quick Facts” for Lincoln, uniquely qualify 
our city for the Smart City Challenge.
Quick Facts: 
• Lincoln’s total population grew more than 15% over the last decade. By 2045 our 
population will jump to over 415,000  bringing with it larger metro mobility issues.
• We control our own destiny – ideas and technologies implemented are not 
influenced by any suburbs or jurisdictional lines – just Lincoln!
• When compared to other peer cities, we fall right in the middle for all three 
categories of: population, land size, and density ( one of only 6 cities  able to make 
this claim)
• Our population, land area, and lack of other jurisdictions makes us able to more 
easily stretch and utilize dollars for city-wide logistics.
• For the average Lincoln citizen, transportation is the second largest expense in 
regards to our cost of living.
• By this coming Fall, we will have the nation’s newest traffic management center, 
newest system software, and newest signal controllers – offering state of the art 
flexibility for integration of new technology.
Freight Flows in America - 2010
Lincoln faces unique transportation challenges due to large-scale trucking and rail corridors 
that move through our city and the state.14
CITY OF LINCOLN• We are presently constructing Fiber-to-the-Home on a city-wide basis and 
leveraging over $120M  in the project that will bring high speed (Gigabit) 
connection to every signal cabinet 
and every public building in the city. 
Communication to all city facilities will 
be provided by this Gigabit network, 
and therefore no grant funding will be 
spent on communications - only on 
advanced technologies.
• Lincoln has recently completed our first 
“Cycle Track” in downtown Lincoln, 
complete with wireless sensors.
• We are already moving forward with a brand new 15 station Bike Share program . 
• Our community is full of Millennials and new technology startup companies. 
• Google  named Lincoln the top eCity in Nebraska for 2015.
• Our current Public Transit system, StarTran, has been awarded the National 
Community Transit Award.
These are just a few of the factors that make the City of Lincoln a great candidate for 
the Smart City Challenge.  We share the vision of the USDOT  in prioritizing the next 
generation of transportation technology to improve safety, enhance mobility, and 
address climate change.  We have a successful track record on deploying technology 
projects, and know we need to stay ahead of the transportation growth curve. We are 
excited to implement a demonstration project that will result in achieving these goals, 
and one that can be duplicated many other cities across the U.S.  A preliminary project 
site map of Lincoln is illustrated on the following page. Forbes Magazine says:
“City of Lincoln is the #3 city 
for young entrepreneurs.”FACT!15
LINCOLN, NE VISION SITE MAP16
CITY OF LINCOLNThe Lincoln Vision Project components fulfill the USDOT Vision Elements.  Table 2  
below provides additional detail.
TABLE 2: USDOT VISION ELEMENTS - LINCOLN, NEBRASKA
ELEMENT  DESCRIPTION                                                             FULFILLS
1Urban 
AutomationUrban automation will be realized through the Lincoln 
Independent Navigation Carriers (LINC) project 
components. Full autonomous, electric, connected shuttle 
and small car transit service will be operated through user 
friendly application interface and enhance/replace current 
transit offerings.
2Connected 
VehiclesThe LINC transit system project component will provide 
600-plus connected vehicles, also integrated with sensors 
and DSRC units at traffic signal locations. This network is 
connected with existing robust communications systems. 
Private vehicles (if equipped) will be able to communicate 
with the infrastructure as well.
3Intelligent, 
Sensor-Based 
InfrastructureSystem-wide non-intrusive sensors will be deployed at traffic 
signal locations to collect additional data beyond existing 
camera detector and Wi-Fi systems. A wealth of vehicle 
count, class, speed, and arrival data will be aggregated at 
the state of the art traffic management center.
4Urban  
AnalyticsData analysis and open data sharing will be provided 
via the City of Lincoln ATMS software system and open 
portal concept at the traffic management center. Research 
facilities, companion agencies, private sector, and public will 
have access to relevant data streams for use in product and 
application development/support.
5User-Focused 
MobilityThe combination of the LINC system and open source 
data will provide for immediate user choice of mobility 
options, and also future application enhancements (example 
- additional rideshare capabilities or delivery options) as 
further applications are evaluated and developed, LINC will 
level the playing field.
6Urban Delivery 
& LogisticsPackage delivery and defined parcel stops will be included 
on a set number of demonstration project vehicles. Lincoln 
will work with local parcel service logistics personnel and 
the U.S. postal service to define synergies that can be 
demonstrated as part of the LINC system. Partnerships 
with private logistics planning consultants could provide 
additional modeling of reduction in business to retail trips.
THE USDOT
VISION ELEMENTS 317
CITY OF LINCOLN7Strategic 
Business Models 
& PartnershipCity of Lincoln has partner stakeholders in both the 
public sector and private sector including local legislative 
representatives, State Dept. of Roads, universities and 
Educational centers, and private entities that are already 
providing and sharing data - both traffic data and GIS/asset 
management data. Education programs are defined and will 
benefit greatly from these partnerships.
8Smart Grid, 
Roadway 
Electrification, 
& EvsAs part of the LINC system deployment, multiple sites 
around the City will be constructed with charging bays and 
additional stations for charging of the fleet during off-peak 
electrical loads. In addition, excess units will be provided 
for private vehicles that begin to convert over, and the City 
Fleet Vehicles.
9Connected, 
Involved 
CitizensBroad access of data will be provided as described in 
project components 2 and 3. However, a large need in this 
portion as well is a focused training and education plan that 
will guide the desire and interest of citizens to stay involved 
throughout the pilot, offering useful feedback.
10Architecture & 
StandardsNational ITS Architecture standards will be followed for 
implementation of the demonstration project. City of 
Lincoln is currently updating the Regional ITS Architecture 
to latest web-based format. In addition, all appropriate 
systems engineering deliverables will be submitted to local 
FHWA and JPO for review.
11Low-Cost, 
Efficient, Secure, 
and Resilient 
Information & 
Communications 
TechnologyAs part of the project elements for DSRC implementation, it 
is envisioned the City will work with USDOT to formalize any 
recommendations based upon the prior RDE open source 
application development portal and the operational data 
exchange.
12 Smart Land UseThe analysis of massive data sets under previous tasks 
could be used to improve “model” development that has 
been conducted by teaming partner Quetica. Preliminary 
descriptions of this modeling effort suggest land use could 
be more advantageously laid out to result in fewer overall 
trips for commercial activities.
Through implementation of the four major project components included in the Lincoln 
vision: – LINC System, Sensors/DSRC deployment, Data Analytics and Performance 
Measurement, and broad based Public Education, there are cross cutting activities that 
fulfill all of the 12 USDOT Vision Elements .  This indeed creates synergy amongst 
the four components – providing demonstration and research opportunities for a large 
portion of the overall vision, while more easily implementing these projects with a 
single, unified Smart City Challenge applicant.  In addition, Lincoln is also leveraging 
our own investment in the following items:
18
CITY OF LINCOLN• High speed broadband network city wide at all signals, all ITS devices, and up to 
150 public building facilities.
• 15 virtual local area network (VLAN’s) at each location for use by the City.
• Newest ATMS software, controllers, and Traffic Management Center in the nation 
at project kickoff. 
The Smart City grant dollars will be fully put to work on the mission at hand – 
implementing and testing a full array of technology to improve mobility for all.
As with any major project of this scale there are risks involved.  The City of Lincoln is 
prepared however, to make this demonstration a success for the USDOT. We take the 
responsibility seriously, and have full commitment of leadership to be successful.

RISKS 419
CITY OF LINCOLNThe Smart City Challenge has created unprecedented inquiry and widespread 
information sharing not only in Lincoln, but across the nation.  Locally, it has led to 
numerous discussions with partner stakeholders and community and industry leaders.  
Lincoln is in an advantageous position – we are a Capital city, and our state Legislature 
meets 4 blocks away from our own City Hall and Public Works Department.  The 
Nebraska Department of Roads is headquartered a short drive away.  When and if 
discussions need to be had and decisions made, we are here in close proximity and can 
coordinate easily.
In addition, many of our “Silicon Prairie” tech startups  continue to grow here in 
Lincoln.  With support from our own University of Nebraska partners, Innovation 
Campus, Lincoln Electric System, and key private entities, the time is ripe for Lincoln.  
An initial listing of those partner stakeholders is included below, and their letters of

CITY OF LINCOLN
The City of Lincoln transportation infrastructure includes the major 6-lane, I-80 freeway 
corridor on the north, and US-Hwy 77 by-pass to the west.  The majority of the major 
arterial street system is a grid network (mile line roadways), with multiple other minor 
arterials and collectors.  Lincoln has a total of 23 centerline miles of freeway, and 160 
centerline miles of arterial roadways.  Lincoln has not had to bisect the community with 
other north/south or east/west freeway facilities to date.  In order to maintain desirable 
travel times and operations, efficiencies will need to be gained through technology and 
improved mode share.
Lincoln’s current and only mass transit system 
is StarTran.  The system operates a total of 67 
full-size coaches and 13 Handi-Vans.  StarTran is 
acknowledged nationally as a leader within the 
transit industry in the utilization and promotion 
of alternative fuels.  The fleet uses compressed 
natural gas (CNG) – nearly 30 buses by the end 
of 2016, and biodiesel – the remainder of the 
fleet.  All StarTran vehicles provide accessible 
service, and automated vehicle location (AVL) 
infrastructure.  The program offers senior center 
promotion services and low income bus passes.  
StarTran also plays a major role in the University 
of Nebraska operations between City Campus 
and East Campus.   A transit development plan 
has just recently been completed to evaluate changes in routes and bus stops and 
proposed modifications.
The City of Lincoln has a robust and redundant  communications network for public 
building infrastructure and the signal system.  Additional copper communications lines 
are still present at few select locations.  Managed Ethernet switch equipment has been 
phased in upgrades over recent years as the City prepares this season  for new signal 
system infrastructure.  Earlier this year, the Mayor announced a major communications 
game changer within the City as part of a public/private partnership.  Fiber-to-the-
home is being deployed to every residence in a massive overbuild.  As part of the 
contract, the city is receiving high-speed Gigabit fiber connections and IP switch gear 
at all traffic signal and ITS cabinets.  In addition, all public buildings are receiving 10Gig 
connections as well.  This has taken the communications infrastructure for the traffic 
management system quickly into the next generation .  The City will also be provided 
15 VLAN’s at each point on the network for future use.  TRANSPORTATION
INFRASTRUCTURE 621
CITY OF LINCOLNIn addition to the great news regarding 
communications upgrades, the City 
just recently announced “Green Light 
Lincoln” , a major prioritization to update 
all 430 traffic signal controllers, new 
central software, and a traffic management 
center.  The project has already begun 
and the TMC is under construction with a 
video wall and new camera management 
software to be complete this Spring.  
The remaining system upgrades will be 
complete by the end of this season with 
plans to do corridor wide signal retiming 
upon implementation.  Lincoln is also 
upgrading several cabinets to state 
of the art infrastructure and has been 
programming detection replacement 
at dozens of intersections with modern 
camera systems.  The impetus for much of 
this work was the development of a Traffic 
Management Master Plan  near the end 
of 2015. 
In the City of Lincoln, the Traffic Engineering team 
within the Public Works Department is responsible 
for the planning, design, operation, and maintenance 
of the City’s over 430 traffic signals.  In addition, a 
network of over 70 CCTV cameras, 50 portable and 
permanent dynamic message signs, and over 150 
miles  of signal/communications conduit infrastructure 
is operated on a daily basis.
In terms of electrification enhancements to the 
transportation system, LES collaborated with the City 
Public Works Department over a year ago to install 
the first electric vehicle charging stations  within 
the West Haymarket parking garages.  In addition, 
efficient power for signals and roadway lighting is 
being provided in the Arena project area by way of a 
District Energy Corporation which operates two centralized thermal energy generating 
plants that serve a wide reach of buildings and facilities.  The city has also partnered 
with LES to install combination wind/solar generators at traffic signals  on the fringe of 
the community to provide full battery back-up and supplemental power.

Traffic Management Master Plan22
CITY OF LINCOLNThe City of Lincoln currently collects traffic volume data for eight peak hours out of the 
day at every signalized intersection and other major intersection locations (roundabouts, 
intersections on threshold of satisfying signal warrants etc.).  The city has begun a 
practice of solely collecting counts 
via the signal system or with non-
intrusive machine vision cameras.  
As such, the operation has become 
efficient and we have counted 
every desired intersection within 
a 2 year period.  The city also 
collects bicycle count data  at 
designated trail locations via loops 
in the pavement and piezometer.  
Wireless magnetic pucks have also 
been installed on the N Street 
cycle track and at select locations 
throughout the City.  Finally, Lincoln has also deployed a number of Bluetooth/Wi-Fi 
detectors at intersections to gain additional data on travel runs for corridor evaluation.
Currently, the City of Lincoln shares and coordinates data locally  with the Lancaster 
County Engineering Department, the Nebraska Department of Roads (NDOR), 
the University of Nebraska Transportation Center (NTC), and other private traffic 
engineering consultants.  Data is now stored in database files that are automated from 
the camera counts, and are available upon request.  With the installation of the new 
software platform, additional travel data and signal timing information will be more 
easily shared with these stakeholders as needed.  The City has created a web portal site 
for easy access to all system information and asset management.  A migration plan to 
upload count data and recent three-year crash data to this portal for open consumption 
is being developed.  An illustration of the web portal is shown below:

CITY OF LINCOLNStandards and architecture for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) will conform to 
the National ITS Architecture and will be checked throughout the project.  The team 
is very familiar with the Systems Engineering process and national ITS architecture 
standards.  The City of Lincoln is presently beginning an update to its prior architecture, 
which will result in the latest version, and updated files in a web-based format.  
This is being conducted in concert with SE process for a new Adaptive Signal Control 
Technology (ASCT) project along a major corridor in North Lincoln.  As part of that 
effort, and in concert with the Model Systems Engineering Documents for Adaptive 
Signal Control Technology, several deliverables have been standardized and are 
included for local FHWA review on any ITS project:
• Project Plan
• Systems Engineering Management Plan (SEMP)
• Concept of Operations (ConOps)
• Requirements
• Verification Plan
• Validation Plan
• Procurement Plan
In addition, the City of Lincoln has familiarized itself with portions of the newer 
Connected Vehicle Reference Implementation Architecture and the on-line tools.

CITY OF LINCOLNSpecific goals, objectives and quantifiable results will be developed and documented 
in much more detail upon final design of the systems.  The four project components 
have been identified with a draft list of designated performance measures that can be 
quantified and documented.  There are a number of additional performance measures 
that can be developed for each objective and additional goals.  These performance 
measures, shown below in Table 3 , will be included in the systems engineering 
documents and provide positive reinforcement for the benefits of the Lincoln vision.  
Online database tools for operational manuals will be housed in the traffic management 
center for timely reporting by the staff operators and Traffic Engineering Division.

CITY OF LINCOLNAs Mayor Beutler stated in our opening cover letter – “we are fully committed to the 
successful, on time completion of this project….this is more than a demonstration 
project – it is opportunity for our city to change thinking, improve our climate, 
and enhance quality of life -”  there is no lack of enthusiasm here in the Midwest.  We 
have the team, leadership, and support from the top down in all City Departments.  
This project will be led by the Traffic Engineering Division with primary support from 
leadership within our own StarTran, and Technology Services Divisions.  All three 
disciplines are located with the Public Works Department and work together daily.  
There will no doubt be additional private consulting assistance, and we have a wealth 
of local and regional ITS consultant expertise familiar with all Systems Engineering 
and design requirements.  We have programmed additional engineering horsepower 
within the next two year budget cycle being finalized now, to move forward with many 
new initiatives in proactive traffic management.  Our infrastructure is ready and being 
improved upon every day.
As mentioned in prior sections, the City of Lincoln has recently launched fully into 
major technology initiatives that will boost its transportation (and other) capabilities 
dramatically.  The city has partnered with Allo Communications to bring direct, high 
speed fiber optic connections to every property in the City.  As part of the on-going 
design and installations, the City is receiving robust connectivity to every device in the 
field including VLAN’s.  In addition, the City’s recent “Green Light Lincoln” initiative 
is bringing new state of the art signal system equipment on-line that will change 
the landscape of traffic management in Lincoln.  These efforts alone are resulting in 
over $120M of investment in Lincoln to facilitate technology projects and the sharing 
economy moving forward.COMMITMENT AND

1. OUR VISION
civic innovation; and our population - both diverse 
and growing - and our streets - both new and old - and our weather - both snowy and sunny - are representative of that of the nation as a whole.  In short, if it is to be invented, odds are its inventors will come from Boston.  And, if it works in Boston, it can work anywhere.
Through the Smart City Challenge grant, we are 
committing to scaling up our already-healthy transportation innovation ecosystem to accelerate progress in three key areas: greater safety for individuals, greater equity across communities, and 
greater climate resilience for cities. 
 
GO BOSTON 2030
We have already laid the groundwork to make 
change in these areas more possible through our long term transportation planning initiative, Go Boston 2030 - our companion to the U.S. DOT’s Beyond Traffic effort.  Zero deaths. Zero injuries.  Zero disparities. Zero emissions.  Zero stress.
This is Boston’s vision for our transportation 
future, and, by creating the nation’s premier Mobility Innovation Lab, we believe we can drive disruption towards achieving these most urgent and most challenging goals.  
We have the inherent attributes to host this lab: 
Boston is home to the world’s greatest cluster of academic institutions; our private sector relishes tackling humanity’s toughest challenges; our local government is a leader in data, technology and ""Boston will create and run a Mobility Innovation Lab for transportation that integrates research, entrepreneurship and practice"" - Mayor WalshPAGE 2
ZERO DISPARITIES.
We want to foster greater financial and social 
mobility by providing greater physical mobility.  Unfortunately, Boston’s transportation network does not serve everyone equally.  
Our hub- and spoke- mass transit system does not 
reach some of our lower-income communities, meaning that a higher share of wallet goes to transportation in some of the neighborhoods that can least afford it.  Additionally, Boston - similar to many cities - can be especially difficult to navigate for our 60,000 residents and 1.5 million annual visitors who identify as having a disability that impacts their mobility.
Our transportation system has to work for 
everyone, no matter where they live or what abilities they have.  
ZERO EMISSIONS.
The City of Boston maintains 850 miles of roadway.  It is projected that almost half of that network, with potential sea level rise, could be vulnerable to severe storm surges during high tides.
Moreover, last winter was a strong reminder that 
we need to be prepared for both long term changes and acute shocks.  With a record snowfall in 2015, much of our transportation network was stressed to the breaking point and some elements of it temporarily shut down.  Go Boston 2030 has been a constituent-driven and data-informed planning process.  We have recently completed and published the vision report and associated goals and targets.  You can read that report at goboston2030.org/vision-framework/.  
To develop that vision, we reached out to connect 
and involve our citizens, both on the street and online.  We wanted to hear from many voices, not just the loudest ones.  Through this process, we were able to engage thousands of residents in a visioning process; and we collected 3,700 policy and investment ideas from constituents from across the region. Below are some of their goals.
ZERO DEATHS.  ZERO INJURIES.
In 2014, more than 1,200 pedestrians and cyclists were involved in crashes in Boston.  Some were minor; most resulted in a hospital visit; and several people died.  We want even one death to be unthinkable.
In 2015, Mayor Walsh announced a Vision Zero 
campaign to eliminate traffic fatalities in our city.  This past December, we issued our action plan, which you can read at visionzeroboston.org.
Sadly, already in 2016, there have been five 
pedestrians in the City of Boston struck and killed by cars, underscoring the importance and urgency of this work.  OUR VISIONPAGE 3 OUR VISION
MOBILITY INNOVATION LAB
In pursuit of those ambitious goals, we will align 
Boston’s “people, places and things” in a Mobility Innovation Lab. While any single innovation could certainly move us forward, we believe that - particularly in this time of rapid technological change - we need to put in place a context and culture for continuous, smart transportation innovation.  
       
PEOPLE: THE TEACHING HOSPITAL  
        FOR  TRANSPORTATION
The best ideas come when entrepreneurs, 
practitioners, and researchers co-create. In the transportation arena, too often those groups are disconnected.  In our city, however, we have a world-renowned model where practitioners and researchers work hand in hand to achieve better results: the teaching hospital.  Here, bedside and bench are united, and high-quality practice and cutting-edge research happen simultaneously. As a coastal economic powerhouse with older infrastructure, we must lead the way in increasing resiliency and improving sustainability by embracing zero emission vehicles and supporting more people walking and biking.
ZERO STRESS.
Overwhelmingly, we heard from residents that transportation in Boston needs to be more reliable and less stressful.  Too often, the bus is late; the drive is unpredictable; the ride is unpleasant.  
While stress may not seem as critical an issue, 
developing a stress-free transportation network will yield many of the small outcomes that reflect progress on other goals: fewer cars idling in jams; more employees getting to work on time; additional commuters feeling confident biking or relying on mass transit.

DataTHINGSPAGE 4 OUR VISION
The digital simulator--an expansion of current 
city simulators from Boston University and other universities -- would allow innovators to model their intervention using a variety of contextual and specific data sets, to understand the impact of their idea on equity, safety and resilience.
Promising ideas will then be tested on city 
“Beta Blocks” or with a “Beta Fleet.”  These will be designated corridors and vehicles in Boston that will be -- and, in some cases, already are -- instrumented so that new technology, materials and uses can be easily tried and evaluated.  Locations will reflect a full range of built environments, and vehicles will comprise a variety of sizes, personal and commercial uses, and modes. With paired locations and built-in sensors to make A/B testing results instantaneous, innovations can be quickly tested in an environment that is representative of urban areas and urban fleets.
Successful interventions on the Beta Blocks or with 
the Beta Fleet will then have quick access to scale in Boston and collaborating cities through hands-on support from the “Scale Team”.  The Scale Team will be a small staff embedded in a select group of cities across the nation -- cities selected for a diversity of representative infrastructure and forward-leaning leadership. These cities will help scale ideas quickly by extending data standards, We envision creating a “Teaching Hospital for Transportation”, co-locating practice, research, and the development of new technology. Cohorts of entrepreneurs from leading startup accelerators, teams of researchers from universities, and government leaders will work side by side to create our next generation streetscapes. The answer you need and the thought partner you seek will never be more than two desks away.
          
PLACE: THE RADICALLY  
           PROGRAMMABLE CITY
Those engaged in the Teaching Hospital for 
Transportation - and the broader transportation innovation community - will not simply need a place to connect; they will need a place to test their ideas, and a way to get them to scale.  
We want a city that is radically programmable 
- where the infrastructure is built for rapidly deploying innovations sourced from anywhere; where new updates mean pushing software and plugging in modular hardware, not rebuilding from scratch with each new improvement.   
Boston will put together infrastructure that shrinks 
the lag that can exist between “study” and “street.”  We will provide three increasingly large arenas for testing: a digital simulator, a set of “Beta Blocks”, and a network of peer cities. PAGE 5 OUR VISION
of streets and sidewalks by time of day and day of 
week; and improving micro-navigation - wayfinding at a hyper local scale.  We believe these projects also drive key steps on the road to autonomy.
Developing this lab and leading these projects 
will be a natural extension of the work already occurring in Boston. We’ve built one of the nation’s leading civic innovation groups, which has already collaborated to establish a housing innovation lab.  We’ve staffed up a citywide analytics group that is pushing the boundaries on using data for quickly designing, implementing, and evaluating policy experiments.  And, through Go Boston 2030, we are setting a new high bar for engagement and analysis as part of  public processes.  This forms a strong municipal foundation for the Mobility Innovation Lab.
We appreciate the opportunity to apply to 
this challenge.  It comes at a great moment of alignment of urgency and opportunity.  We’re excited to work with you and other cities across the country to get started.drafting policy, and helping entrepreneurs and researchers communicate and adjust their concept for the next set of constituents and practitioners.  
       
THINGS: DATA 
Boston is data rich. We are already leading 
extensive efforts to catalog, combine, curate, and use transportation data. Extending those efforts through this grant, we will transform data sets to meet available data standards where possible; where necessary, we will crowd-source the development of new standards through collaboration with our public and private sector partners. To ensure that data is research- and product-ready, we will implement APIs and the privacy & security policies necessary to ensure easy access and appropriate use.  Our core data vision is to default to open data, either hosting the data ourselves or through a partner, and surfacing updated data at the pace needed for reliable products and meaningful research..
OUR  PROJECTS
To help prime the pump for future innovations, the City itself envisions leading a small set of projects. These projects will  include: implementing the “Key to the City” - a single booking and payment system to access all modes of travel throughout Boston; deploying Mobile Eye and EV technology in the City fleet; testing ways to dynamically adjust the use PAGE 6
We need to build the capacity within cities and 
within government to be more agile in the face of this disruption, more responsive to the changing needs of our constituents, and more capable of testing and scaling good ideas, continuously.  
With its alignment of “people,” “places,” and 
“things”, the mobility lab is that infrastructure for continuous innovation.
2. OUR PLAN 
the Mobility Innovation Lab
We seek to create the nation’s premier Mobility Innovation Lab.  This lab will help drive innovation to improve equity, safety and resilience.
We are at incredible moment of disruption 
in transportation. Low-cost and high quality consumer technology, robotics, and data analytics have fueled a new generation of services.  Meanwhile, a resurgence of cities, growing economic disparities, and the acute shocks and long term risks of climate change have left city leaders seeking newer ways to help people move safely, equitably, and sustainably.PAGE 7 OUR PLAN: PEOPLE  The “Teaching Hospital for Transportation”

BACKGROUND: Boston has one of the most robust 
university ecosystems on earth, paired with one of the most engineering-equipped innovation scenes. Unsurprisingly, Boston has originated an impressive array of disruptive research and start ups in the mobility arena. However, these innovators talk to each other extensively only at conferences or via private phone calls.  We believe far more can be achieved if these groups naturally worked more closely together.
KEY ACTIONS: 
ResearchersProvide a cohort of professors and postdoctoral students with concierge access to city resources and opportunities for on-street research, including randomized control trial infrastructure. Partners will include - among others - the Boston Area PAGE 8
 
IDEAS FESTIVALS
To accelerate adoption of good ideas, we need to 
help mobility interventions catch the imagination of the public consciousness. Too often, cutting edge mobility concepts remain buried in the pages of peer-reviewed journals and poster presentations.
We plan on making geeky innovations cool through 
already-established and popular idea festivals. Sharing ideas on the public stage where people come to shake up the conventional wisdom allows ideas to catch the public imagination and change attitudes, building demand for their implementation.  It also attracts new talent to the field. TedxCambridge  and Aspen Ideas Festival  have both been brainstorming how to structure Smart Cities themes with us.recruiting, providing space, and programming.

TRACK RECORD: We helped found the Boston Area 
Research Initiative, a cross-university consortium of professors who study cities.  We teamed up to develop District Hall, a public space for Boston’s innovation community, which was so successful it was expanded to a second public innovation center in Roxbury in 2015. We have helped support MassChallenge, VentureCafe, and other innovation labs. 
 
 OUR PLAN: PEOPLE  The “Teaching Hospital for Transportation”PAGE 9 OUR PLAN: PLACE The Radically Programmable City
KEY ACTIONS: 
The Simulator
For the first stage of testing, we partner with local universities to provide a simulator that uses as inputs the design, services and data of our city.  The microcosm of a programmable city, this simulator will be publicly available through the Mobility Innovation Lab. The simulator will, in particular, allow us to screen for anticipated impact on equity, safety and resilience. Boston University, and MIT  have variants of this simulators.
The Beta Block & The Beta Fleet
For the second stage of testing, we designate 3-5 “Beta Block” corridors in our city.  These blocks are specifically for testing all the newest ideas: instrumented to make it easy to push or plug in new technology, try out new roadway materials, propose new curb rules, and evaluate experiments. Blocks are paired with other locations with similar metrics, and instrumented for instantaneous results to allow for easy research and A/B testing. Transportation for America  has offered to pair locations on metrics. Sidewalk Labs, Current GE  among others have flexible hardware. Boston University, Harvard, Northeastern  and UMass  have suggested their campuses.
Similarly, working with major area fleet providers  
including our own - we will identify vehicles - a “Beta Fleet”-  where it will be quick to pilot EV and PURPOSE: We will provide the means for new ideas 
to go rapidly from lab simulation to on-street to citywide and nationwide scale.

CONTEXT:  Transportation is being rapidly 
disrupted. What we can predict about the future is that it is unknown. Our infrastructure must be built for this exciting reality. Rather than needing to be rebuilt for each new innovation, infrastructure should be built to allow new deployments to be easy, smooth and scalable. The cityscape must be radically programmable.
The US DOT award goes to only one city, but the 
aim is to transform transportation across the nation. To realize this mission, it will be necessary to design projects with a path to scale from the star. As any startup founder can tell you, there is a world of difference between showing that a solution produces benefits in the real world and scaling it to multiple locations. City infrastructure and partnerships can and should smooth the path to scale. We can create structures that make it easy to bring solutions to scale seamlessly.  PAGE 10
TRACK RECORD:  We have helped scale civic apps 
developed or deployed first with the City of Boston 
to dozens of cities and towns across the nation.  These include apps such as Citizens Connect  
(Spot Reporters), Commonwealth Connect, Where’s My School Bus, and Adopt-A-Hydrant. 
Additionally, over the last three years, we 
have increasingly opened up our streets for experimentation. Boston was the first test site for Soofa, a solar-paneled charging station and bench now found throughout the nation; we’ve additionally piloted camera analytics and car sensing technologies and installed digital trip-planning signs offering real-time travel information. The City’s Innovation Team launched the Public Space Invitational, an opportunity for artists, designers and architects to propose and pilot installations in our streets and parks, expanding our streetscapes.   connected technologies, among others.
The Scale Team
To take success pilots to scale, we will partner with 5-7 cities across the country and support a “Scale Team” of 3-5 dedicated staff.  The Scale Team would be embedded in transportation departments in other cities; they would give entrepreneurs a perspective of how various components work in different cities during concept development and early iteration, and next help take proven concepts to other cities. Cities are selected to represent a wide variety of city infrastructures and forward leaning leadership.   Los Angeles ,and University of Pennsylvania  have offered to be partners.
2016 PROJECTS: Launch the simulator. (Several 
universities already have platforms.) Select and instrument the first Beta Block and identify the Beta Fleet. (Projects launch-ready with BU.) Select peer cities and hire Scale Team. (Conversations already on going with Los Angeles.)

ondOUR PLAN: PLACE The Radically Programmable CityPAGE 11 OUR PLAN: THINGS Data
CORE CONCEPT:  To fuel transportation research and 
product development, we will provide easy access to 
both specific and contextual transportation data, with clear use and privacy policies.  
VISION ELEMENTS:
- Urban Analytics- Architecture & Standards- Low-Cost, Efficient, Secure, and Resilient ICT
BACKGROUND:  Transportation data abounds; however, 
it is often locked away in multiple systems, neither clean, nor well-annotated, nor compliant with any standards.  Everyone agrees that this data could have more utility.  The challenges are legal (e.g. consents); technical (e.g. storage, APIs, privacy); and operating (e.g. standards).
There is tremendous effort on this already. Boston’s 
universities host the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center, built for the computationally intensive research that will be required for this work. They also host the Mass Open Cloud and the Dataverse, both of which make data accessible and easy to use for these types of use cases. Inside City Hall, we have built out a fifteen person Citywide Analytics Team of researchers and data scientists dedicated to improving service delivery to residents across Boston.  
We believe that an intensive focus on transportation 
data and related datasets could build off this platform to deliver incredible value beyond what we have today. Key Actions:
 We will mak
e all relevant, appropriate 
datasets research- and product-ready. This means they will be open, standardized, and accessible via APIs. We will dedicate a data librarian position to answer transportation data questions and help build connections to more real-time data sources. We will update requisite privacy policies. We will transform data sets to comply with existing standards, enforcing and extending those standards as needed.  We will work with start-ups, industry, and researchers to open-source and co-locate their data exhaust.
Boston Area Research Initiative has offered to help 
make our datasets research-ready . Other partners who have helped spearhead joint data efforts include Boston University  Harvard, and Waze 
2016 PROJECTS:  Create easy to use APIs and research-
ready access for top priority datasets. Bring on a transportation data librarian. (BARI is ready to offer its assistance on this.)
MEASURE OF SUCCESS:
Input:  # of easy-to-use data sets made availableOutput:  Frequency and volume of data accessed by researchersOutcome: # of original products developed and research performed; expansion of adoption of data standards.
TRACK RECORD:  Over the last two years, since Mayor 
Walsh signed an executive order on Open Data, the City has built out a 15-person citywide analytics team, formed data partnerships with, among others, Waze and Uber; ran multiple data-focused hackathons; and maintained an extensive open data portal, viewable at data.boston.gov.  PAGE 12
3. OUR PROJECTS
Paths to safety, equity and resilience 
CONNECTED & ELECTRIC VEHICLES
CORE CONCEPT: To improve the health & safety of 
pedestrians, cyclists, bus riders, and drivers, we will 
expand the use of electric vehicles and vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-person technology.
VISION ELEMENTS:
- Connected Vehicles- Smart Grid, Roadway Electrification,    Electric Vehicles
CONTEXT:  Five cyclists in Boston alone have died in 
crashes with trucks in the last three years.  Perhaps the greatest promise of connected vehicles is to increase the awareness of drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians to avoid crashes.  Moreover, a next generation fleet is not just a connected fleet; it is also a zero-emissions fleet.  The City’s Central Fleet Management (CFM) Division currently oversees a fleet over 1,100 vehicles. CFM looks to replace anywhere from 5-10% of this fleet each year, and aspires to do many more. CFM would jump at the opportunity to pull older, inefficient vehicles off the road in batches and to replace them with EVs. We would also be thrilled to improve our charging infrastructure and increase employee access to EVs. 
In addition to our MBTA buses, CFM is very intrigued 
by the possibility of installing Mobile Eye sensors in the City’s fleet. Accidents are a significant problem for us, and we welcome forward-leaning solutions to mitigate accidents in a city well known for its narrow, congested streets and aggressive driving. PAGE 13 OUR PROJECTS: CONNECTED & ELECTRIC VEHICLES
fatalities or injuries; decrease in fleet emissions
TRACK RECORD:  In 2013 we launched the nation’s 
largest truck sideguard pilot project on our own 
fleet with research support from the USDOT Volpe Center. After a successful trial on 16 trucks, Mayor Walsh enacted an ordinance that requires all vendors doing business with our City to install side guards, special mirrors, and safety decals to their trucks weighing over 10,000 pounds.  After six months with our city vendor ordinance in effect, we have gone from our initial 16 truck pilot to more than 60 trucks equipped with upgraded safety devices.
2013 also marked when we began replacing city 
fleet vehicles with EV’s. Since then we have grown the initial fleet by 10x, with another 50% growth planned in 2016 (see Our City).
CORE CONCEPT:  Enable citywide mobility as a 
service, by providing integrated and account-based payment for all mobility options in the city. KEY ACTIONS:  
Connected VehiclesDeploy Mobile Eye sensors on relevant City or other regional fleets.  Explore additional people-to-vehicle technology through the Mobility Innovation Lab.  Potential partners include Mobile Eye and Nodal .
Electric Vehicles
Collaborate with Vulcan on a plan to increase EV infrastructure and switch more cars to zero emission vehicles, through a partnership with the City’s fleet or other major fleet.
  
2016 PROJECTS: Scope and undertake an initial 
deployment of Mobile Eye sensors either with the MBTA or with the City’s own large vehicle fleet.  Support at least three start-ups or researchers using connected vehicle technology to address Vision Zero objectives.

BACKGROUND: Many of our communities with the 
highest percentage of low income families are least well served by transit now. Consequently, many are forced to either own a vehicle, spending a larger share of their paycheck on transportation, or take long and often unreliable trips on transit.Unifying payment platforms across services and providing personalized payment account would have two major benefits. First, easier  enrollment in and payment of  alternative modes of transportation should speed both expansion to and adoption in underserved areas. Second, an account-based payment system allows us to explore discounting prices by geography, mode, time of day or traveler to meet equity and resilience objectives.
KEY ACTIONS:  Implement “Key to the City”, an 
integrated and account-based method to pay for all modes of travel. Used for mass transit, bike share, car share, para-transit, etc..

time. With modern user interfaces, uses can be 
crowdsourced and provide surge capacity in times of increased need or resiliency in disasters.    
KEY ACTIONS:  Equip streets with programmable 
markings, and allow back-end programming. Build corresponding user interfaces and V2I lane standards.  Potential partners include Google Sidewalk  SENSEable City Lab  and Waze .
2016 PROJECTS:  Install zoning by hour in one 
BetaBlock location. Run several interventions.  
MEASURE OF SUCCESS:
Inputs: # of tests of dynamic street zoningOutputs: # of dynamics rezonings implemented
Outcomes: % decrease in congestion during peak times, % increase in street use during off-hours
TRACK RECORD: In 2015 we began a partnership 
with E-Ink to develop dynamic low-power regulatory signs that would replace the clutter of signage in some of our neighborhoods.We are working through the prototype now with an intended deployment this summer.  
 CORE CONCEPT:  Boston’s streets and sidewalks 
comprise our largest public space.  This space is too valuable in a dynamic city to have an essentially fixed use. Experiment with programmable markings in streets to allow streets whose purpose adjusts by time, day and season, as demand requires. Build for V2I for connected and autonomous vehicle navigation.
VISION ELEMENTS:
- Smart Land Use- Intelligent sensor based infrastructure- Urban Delivery & Logistics
BACKGROUND:  Street space is one of the most 
constrained commodities in old cities like Boston. Freeing up street space is pivotal for increasing active transportation and decreasing congestion and emissions. It also paves the way for autonomous vehicles.  But, currently, our streets are “zoned” once, when they are striped; “rezoning” them can be controversial, lumbering, costly, and construction-intensive.
By allowing for dynamic allocation of our 
streetscapes, we not only will free up new street space, without building new roads, but also will allow for active streets at times of day and year that they might have otherwise been deserted -- switching between thoroughfare, loading zones, street hockey, and extra parking at any given OUR PROJECTS: ZONING BY HOURPAGE 16
CORE CONCEPT: Build micro-navigation systems for 
way-finding for the last 30 feet where GPS cannot 
direct to a precise destination. Test to boost accessibility for the visually impaired.
VISION ELEMENTS:
- User-focused mobility services and choices- Urban delivery and logistics
BACKGROUND: Current GPS navigation can only 
take you most of the way to your destination now, and leaves you at that last 30 feet without clear guidance to find where you are going. This is particularly difficult for the visually impaired.  Solving this challenge not only helps the 7.3 million visually impaired individuals in  US, but also the general population. 
Fine-tuned micro-navigation could also have 
great utility for any future autonomous vehicles or delivery devices, searching not just for an open space but a particular space. KEY ACTIONS:  Develop and pilot mechanisms to do 
high-precision way-finding in the last 30 feet to a destination. 
2016 PROJECTS: Pilot micro-navigation for 
Bostonians with vision impediments for several navigation use cases around the city.  Perkins, the oldest school for the blind in the US, is spearheading these efforts and is collaborating with the city on development and deployment. OUR PROJECTS: MICRO NAVIGATIONPAGE 17
No area of tech-driven innovation holds more 
promise than autonomous vehicles. They could cut crashes, reduce congestion and free up scarce street space for alternative public use.
But, those outcomes are not guaranteed. Hyper-
mobility could also lead to hyper-sprawl and increased congestion; high tech vehicles may be too expensive for too many, increasing inequity; and, a road full of autonomous vehicles may be safe for pedestrians, but it may not be pleasing for either the occupant or the pedestrian to be on.
There is a pivotal moment before autonomous 
vehicles reach scale and ubiquity, where the right preconditions allow our cities to avoid these outcomes. 
We want to make sure that autonomous vehicles 
work great for cities - that they are safe, accessible, zero emission and managed in a way that complements the vibrancy of urban street life.  The projects outlined in this section intentionally help us move the technology, our policy, and our community forward towards those ends, in this window of time.
PIVOTAL PRECONDITIONS:
Accessible: Our Key to the City project supports a cultural shift towards mobility as a service. We believe that shift will continue to allow a rise in more affordable alternatives to personal car ownership. 
Safe & Green: Our connected and electric vehicle 
projects help us deliver on the promise of safe and green vehicles.
Complementary: Our zoning by hour pilot will 
help us explore new methods to manage the right 
of way to balance the needs of all residents. And, our micro-navigation project will fine-tune our ability to help people and things navigate busy city streets.
These pilots help push the development of 
technology towards an autonomous vehicle that works for cities - no matter their complexity - and for residents - no matter their mode.OUR PROJECTS:  AUTONOMY
     GRAND PRIX FOR  
     A
UTONOMOUS VEHICLES
To familiarize the public with autonomous vehicles, Boston envisions co-hosting an autonomous vehicle showcase as part of IndyCar’s Grand Prix of Boston event on Labor Day.  IndyCar has begun conversations with 
Boston on how to structure a showcase.

Boston is diverse, young and growing. More than 
one quarter of Boston residents are foreign born, and more than half of Boston residents are people of color. More than one third of our population is between the ages of 20 and 34 -- a higher percentage of millennials than any other city in the nation. Between 2000 and 2010, the city grew by 5%, the highest rate of any major U.S. metro area.  In many ways, we are a mirror of urban centers around the country - growing rapidly and working towards a better future.
Mark Twain once quipped, “In New York they ask, 
‘How much is he worth?’; in Philadelphia, ‘Who were his parents?’; in Boston, ‘How much does he know?’”  While some cities export oranges or cars, Boston exports PhDs and MBAs. The city is home to 35 educational and research institutions, a slice of the more than 50 in the metropolitan area.4.1  ABOUT BOSTON
Boston makes a perfect home for the nation’s premier 
Mobility Innovation Lab.
Boston is the largest city in New England. In 2010, 
617,000 residents called Boston home -- 14.7% of the total population of the urbanized area. It is estimated that Boston’s residential population today exceeds 650,000, and our daytime population grows by an additional 340,000 people 
as individuals travel into the 
city for work or school.  
With more than 12,500 people per square mile, Boston is more dense than similarly-sized cities such as Baltimore, Seattle and Washington D.C.. Packed within our 48 square miles are 26 neighborhoods, 850 miles of roadway, and thousands of acres of parks.

first comprehensive plan in 50 years.  There are 
additional large-scale planning efforts underway in housing, arts, schools, and open space that will reimagine this city for generations to come. But it’s not just about planning for the future, it’s about acting now.
In the last year, the City has partnered with Zipcar 
and Enterprise carshare to expand ‘car-lite’ living along the transit rail networks. We expanded Hubway, our bike-share network with new stations throughout the city and continued to work on expansion with our neighbors in Cambridge and Somerville. We’ve launched a mobile app to pay parking meters, which is now being used over 11,000 times every day.  We’ve taken a collaborative approach to startup transportation solutions like Bridj, Uber, and Lyft sharing data and curb space. We’ve worked with the traffic app Waze to run controlled experiments focused on road congestion and bicyclist safety. All of that happened after the worst winter on record; imagine the pace of experimentation in a year the city does not receive more than 100 inches of snow!
These efforts from City Hall have come through 
collaboration both within the building and with outside partners.  The Boston Transportation Department (BTD), the Department of Innovation & Technology (DoIT) and the Mayor’s Office of New It’s not uncommon for global leaders and Fortune 500 CEOs to have spent at least four years of their lives in Boston. People come here to learn, and they take what they experience in our city and share it around the world. And, while we export many ideas and highly-educated individuals, we focus most on helping each of our own residents reach her or his fullest potential.
Like all large cities, we are also facing monumental 
challenges in the years ahead. Income inequality is at historic highs; aging infrastructure is exacerbated by climate change; and, the stress on our transportation systems continues to increase as our population expands towards 700,000.   
All of these challenges have solutions, and, under 
the leadership of Mayor Martin J. Walsh, we are committed to solving them collaboratively with the urgency the deserve.  
4.2 OUR CITY TEAM
Since taking office in 2014, Mayor Walsh has tackled 
some of Boston’s largest challenges by engaging residents in long-term planning and leading his staff in using data to drive decision making.
We are nearing completion of the City’s Go Boston 
2030 transportation plan.  This is one component of City’s comprehensive land use plan -- the PAGE 20 OUR CITY
an ongoing grant. The Boston Transportation 
Department signs Access Plan Agreements with the developers of new building projects. These agreements could be leveraged for the installation of sensors, electric vehicle charging stations, and other potential smart infrastructure such as designated bays for automated vehicles in every new building in Boston.
For this grant, we would look to see how elements 
of it - such as “Beta Blocks” - could be incorporated into major reconstruction projects that are funded through the Boston MPO Transportation Improvements Program (TIP). For example, the Boston University campus is anchored around Commonwealth Avenue, a major arterial in Boston with street car service. A section of this corridor will undergo an $18 million reconstruction starting in Fall 2016 and provides an opportunity to install smart infrastructure connecting students to transit, shared transportation services, and flexible on-street parking in partnership with the the university. This multi-modal corridor, which includes a protected cycle track, will be a cutting-edge “connected” Complete Street. 
Similarly, we will explore how current and future 
NSF-funded grants on which we collaborate with area universities could reinforce the smart city objectives of the US DOT.Urban Mechanics (MONUM) have been leading transportation transformation efforts within City Hall.  BTD manages transportation and develops the City’s policies; DoIT - and their 15-person citywide analytics team - have been core partners in analyzing operations and designing & evaluating pilots; and, MONUM - one of the nation’s first civic innovation groups - has been building partnerships to explore and advance the next generation of service delivery. Reflective of the Mayor’s interest in transportation innovation, he recently appointed one of the founders of MONUM to serve as Boston’s Chief of Streets, overseeing BTD and Public Works.
Staff from these groups would all be deeply 
involved in (and sit in) the Mobility Innovation Lab.
Leverage
Any project within City Hall almost always includes a partner from outside of City Hall. In this last year, we’ve worked with local startups to launch new parking apps, with well-established companies to expand transportation options, and with major universities to embed research fellows within City government. These deep collaborations are a core reason for success, and central to our Mobility Innovation Lab proposal.
We also leverage existing projects to increase 
impact, whether it is a new construction or PAGE 21
WALKING
Boston is known as a great walking city. It was 
designed with the pedestrian in mind. Streets are lined with sidewalks and trees; neighborhoods are anchored by main streets, providing short walks to corner stores and job opportunities; and some transit access is within walking distance of nearly all areas in the city.  In fact, more than one third of all trips during the day are on foot. While we have among the lowest rates of in-street crashes in the country, Boston has launched an aggressive Vision Zero campaign to entirely eliminate traffic related fatalities.
BIKING
Visionaries such as Frederick Law Olmsted began building a “necklace” of open space corridors in the 1880’s that began an eventual network of 50 miles of off-road bike paths through parks and along water.  Since 2007, Boston has added another 104 miles of on-road bike facilities. In 2015 it started construction of 2.4 miles of on-sidewalk protected cycle tracks, with support from a TIGER grant.  Importantly, Boston distributed 1,132 free bikes to low-income residents in 2014 and taught bike riding and safety classes to 6,202 students in grades 2-12 in 2015.  Not surprisingly, average daily bike ridership has doubled since 2007.  4.3 OUR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE
Innovation in transportation has a long legacy in 
Boston. 
We’ve been reinventing how people get around for centuries -- from the country’s fastest clipper ships in the 1850s to our nation’s first subway tunnel in 1897; from building its first underwater transit line in the 1920s to placing a moratorium on surface highway construction in the 1970s; from ZipCar’s founding in 2000 and to the first of Bridj’s dynamic pick-up locations in 2015. Our system has transformed due to bold investments and big ideas from public and private actors.
This transformation has given Boston an established 
multimodal network that provides a platform for continuing innovation today.  Every morning, fewer than half of all Bostonians drive or carpool to work and more trips start within Boston than outside the city.  Shorter trips, many travel options, compact geography, and a young population is fertile ground for new ways to connect people, modes of transport, and places.
Boston’s backbone of fixed infrastructure and 
its fast-growing use of new mobility alternatives provide opportunities for connecting people to transportation services and for these services to connect to each other in ways that will redefine the nation’s next generation of smart cities.OUR CITYPAGE 22
This hard-wired infrastructure is being added to 
with the current installation of 8,000 smart parking meters throughout the city, complementing our existing parking payment mobile app - Park Boston.  
SHARING
The City of Boston is committed to fostering an atmosphere that is supportive of innovative economic models that bridge the divide between residents, worker, visitors and suppliers of goods and services. 
Today, more and more Bostonians are embracing 
the convenience of shared-transportation in their daily travel.  New on-demand services such as Zipcar and Enterprise, Uber and Lyft, and Bridj are complementing and filling gaps in the traditional system, reducing reliance on private vehicles.  Carshare vehicles are available in 245 private lots, and, last year, the City made available 80 additional public locations for carshare vehicles.  According to ZipCar, its 850,000 members in the Boston area reduce 1.3 billion pounds of C02 per year.
The City-managed bike-share service, Hubway, 
experienced over a million trips in 2015 supported by 109 stations with 1,851 docks in Boston and more in three surrounding municipalities.    TRANSIT
More than 1.3 million people board public transportation in the Boston region every day.  They use four rapid transit, three streetcar, and 13 commuter rail lines in addition to more than 150 bus and trackless trolley routes. They access the trains – subway, commuter rail, and streetcars – via 124 stops, 77 of which are within the city. Boston has the nation’s fifth-largest mass transit system by ridership.  2014’s 400 million trips were the highest in the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s history, despite a 5% fare increase and a steep drop in gas prices. Additionally, The Ride, the MBTA’s paratransit service, provides door to door service for people with physical, cognitive, and mental disabilities.
DRIVING
The Boston Transportation Department is focused on operating over 800 miles of roadway more efficiently.  Its Traffic Management Center controls close to 500 signals remotely supported by 250 closed circuit cameras and linked by an extensive fiber optic cable network. Additional data is collected on traffic flow through a series of inductive loops at major intersections throughout the city.  OUR CITYMAP

strong analytical insights from the data, Boston 
can catalyze transportation entrepreneurship by opening up data for use by the broader community. 
Fulfilling an executive order by Mayor Walsh, 
Boston released the City’s Open and Protected Data Policy in July 2015 to make data open, machine-readable, standards-compliant, and easily discoverable. It lays out a process for releasing open data, establishes a Creative Commons license for all data released by the City, and provides a framework for responsibly sharing data with researchers and other partner organizations. The City’s policies and public datasets are at data.boston.gov.
We have hosted or supported hackathons on 
transportation, healthcare, human trafficking, and permitting. Every year, Boston partners with local universities including Harvard, MIT, Northeastern, and UMass to provide additional datasets for academic research and analysis.
DATA LIBRARIANS
The City is developing a comprehensive catalog of City data and is partnering with area research librarians to make this information more readily accessible.  This work is funded through a grant from the Knight Foundation’s News Challenge competition.  This holistic approach to City data The City also manages its own car share program for its employees; that fleet includes two electric vehicles.
ELECTRIC
There are 47 additional charging locations on city streets and in private garages. New developments and garages are required through transportation access plan agreements to provide additional charging locations in order to support more EV’s in denser areas. Meanwhile, Boston is continuing to add electric and hybrid-electric vehicles to its municipal fleet.
4.4 OUR DIGITAL TRANSPORTATION 
INFRASTRUCTURE
One of our core assets for this effort is our data 
and, more importantly, our culture and leadership in using data and technology to improve service delivery.  
Under Mayor Walsh, the City of Boston has built a 
strong transportation data ecosystem, analyzing existing data more effectively, establishing more internal and external data sources, and ultimately using data to improve quality of life for Boston’s citizens.
OPEN & PROTECTED DATA
We know that while the City can and will deliver OUR CITYPAGE 25
for trips, allowing us to better manage the system.
Inductive loops
Copper loop detectors installed in roadways around the region enable us to conduct quick analyses of traffic flows at intersections and along corridors.  
Crowd-sourced safety comments and locations
Using a crowd-sourced map, Boston’s Vision Zero Initiative has collected transportation safety concerns across the city, providing a precise, granular view of public concerns
311 Reports
Boston receives thousands of transportation-related basic city service requests each year from residents that help us do our job, from enforcement requests to reports of missing signs.  Data is published in the Open 311 standard.
Transit Data
Through our collaboration with the MBTA, we have access to a wide range of data about bus, subway, and commuter rail usage, schedules, and service levels
Other Transportation & Contextual Data
We continue to pursue data partnerships with organizations such as  INRIX, Strava Metro allows researchers and developers to integrate transportation-related data with other datasets to power more advanced forms of analytics.  
KEY TRANSPORTATION DATA SETS
Parking Tickets & Parking Meter UsageTransaction data allows us to understand parking trends and violations, which can be used to adjust our enforcement strategy and parking policies.
Motor vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle crash data
This geo-located data enables the City to track all crashes on roadways that required an emergency medical response as well as information about the severity of the crash.
Waze Jams and Alerts
As part of the Waze Connected Citizen Partnership, we receive speed data, and automatically-detected and user-generated traffic jam reports.  
Uber trips
Our unique data-sharing agreement allows the City to see details about Uber trips in Boston, providing a window into TNC demand, and possible locations with insufficient transit or last-mile access.
Hubway
We track usage of the region’s bike share system including time, origin, and destination information OUR CITYPAGE 26
bicycle lanes, or increased “blocking the box” 
enforcement. We have also experimented with novel interventions such as responding to reports of double parked cars reported through Waze with bike-mounted parking enforcement officers.
Improving Safety By Using Data
To support the City’s Vision Zero initiative to reduce serious injuries and eliminate fatalities resulting from crashes on our roadways, Boston Transportation Department (BTD), Emergency Medical Services (EMS), and Boston Police Department (BPD) are now sharing datasets from different systems.
This data includes vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle 
crash location, severity, and injury/fatality statistics. We will analyze this data to see trends in traffic behavior, and identify design changes that reduce collisions, injury, and death.
Developing and Promoting Standards
Many topics of interest in urban transportation, lack formal or informal data standards, or have standards which are not designed to facilitate collaboration or real-time coordination between connected systems. Some examples include:(cycling and running), and Google Maps, to better understand travel patterns and demand across modes.  This data, combined with housing, permitting and employment data, can paint a fuller picture of how people move - and could move better - in Boston.
NEXT EFFORTS IN TRANSPORTATION DATA & 
ANALYSIS 
Improving Traffic Flow Using Data
In February 2015, Boston began its data-sharing agreement with Waze, the traffic app owned by Google that allows road users to check real-time traffic conditions on Boston’s streets.
This data-sharing agreement allows Boston’s Traffic 
Management Center (TMC) to push road closure alerts to drivers, and gives the TMC real-time and historic speed, alerts and traffic jam data to inform traffic signal timing and incident response  Using this data, we’ve been able to document an 18% reduction in traffic jams at a key intersection in the city as a result of improved signal timing by the TMC.
Waze data has allowed Boston to better evaluate 
the impacts of infrastructure projects and policy changes, such as the installation of protected OUR CITYPAGE 27
Standardized or model data sharing agreements 
reduce the time and cost to establish a research or policy-making partnership. These could evolve into a well-defined menu of licensing models, privacy rules, and use restrictions, in the spirit of Creative Commons. 
The use of APIs can allow researchers and policy-
makers to safely query sensitive datasets. As a hypothetical example, rather than providing  detailed trip-level data to a government or a researcher, a TNC could offer an API that allows interested parties to run a queries on rider demand for travel between two census tracts at different times of day. This would provide significant value, while protecting privacy and trade secrets of the data provider. Data from multiple operators could be pooled together by a trusted third party or via distributed trust systems like Blockchain to allow visibility into the transportation system, without any single organization risking the release of its proprietary data.- Regulations on the use of curb space (parking

Our aim is not to replace traditional standards 
making processes, but to develop, document, and evolve lightweight data standards alongside the development of applications and research projects. As a convener regulator, and provider, the City and its government partners will create a forum for data  formats to be defined and implemented. Our regulatory power may allow us to incentivize private parties to share data and participate in a standards definition process.
Making Data Easier to Share
We are pursuing techniques to address the legal barriers, privacy fears, and competitive concerns that often conspire to make data sharing difficult. OUR CITYPAGE 28
5. MANAGEMENT & METRICS
to be explained in a manner in which connected, 
involved citizens prefer to consume them. User interfaces on many innovations also allow regular 
feedback mechanisms and rapid iteration. 
 
THE THINGS DO NOT SCALE.  Severity: 4/10.  
Mitigation: Our in-house scale team’s dedicated 
job is to identify components that are not scaling 
well, diagnose, and test solutions. Having the team in place from the beginning allows scale-proofing concepts from conception through completion. The legal and privacy gets mired. Severity: 9/10. Mitigation: Our teaching hospital model draws on cutting-edge privacy data scientists and legal minds, sitting next to each other as they encounter new problems. We will create defaults that work for most, and have easy-access consulting open hours for the complex cases. 5.1 RISK MANAGEMENT
Any project this large faces execution risks. We 
have tried to build an anticipation of these risks into the fabric of the plan itself. In particular:
THE TECH DOES NOT WORK . Severity: 8/10 . 
Mitigation: By having both a simulator and on-
street testing via “Beta Blocks” along with quick iteration cycles, any tech glitches can be caught early. This depends on having testing environments that closely mirror the rest of the city, which will be a selection criterion for our Beta Block areas. 
THE PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE IT.  Severity: 5/10.  
Mitigation: GoBoston 2030, Boston’s visioning 
lab, means that we start with strong, resident-led calls to action, both quantitative, and, importantly, qualitative.  Idea Festivals paired with high spectacle demonstration sites (e.g., BetaBlocks) allow ideas PAGE 29 MANAGEMENT & METRICS 
In between these long-term targets and program 
level measures are a set of metrics that will help us understand whether our interventions are on track.  The specific metrics are in development, and we have had several conversations with local universities about how best to establish them.  The family of indexes we envision includes:
MOBILITY INDEX
A means to understand how time and cost of travel by mode between fixed points in the city change over time, while controlling for growth.  This helps us understand how efficiently we are moving people through the city.   
ACCESSIBILITY INDEX
A means to understand how close in time and cost any particular residence is to a set of destinations including job centers, shopping and schools.  This helps us unite our land use, equity and transportation strategies.
SAFETY INDEX
A means to track both crash statistics and the feeling of safety for pedestrians, cyclists, transit riders and drivers. This helps us focus our Vision Zero efforts on 
those interventions with the biggest impacts.
RESILIENCE INDEX
A means to track emissions at a granularity in time 
and location that gives us greater utility in our daily street planning, design and management.  THE PARTNERSHIPS GET CUMBERSOME. Severity 
2/10. Mitigation:  Several partners have offered 
their expertise in managing communities of partners, and have long track records doing just that. This includes BARI, MassChallenge, and the Mass Open Cloud. Moreover, many have a track record of working together. This is also an area of strong City expertise, exemplified by MONUM’s work.
THE GOVERNANCE GETS COMPLICATED. Severity: 
4/10. Mitigation: Universities have proactively 
offered their campuses for “BetaBlocks,” ensuring that leaders are already bought in. With radical programmability, fewer choices are set in stone, and more are dynamic, allowing a lower stakes community process. With clear metrics, and instantaneous measurement, programs can be continually monitored to ensure they are achieving the original goals. 
5.2 METRICS
Our long-term targets are clear: zero deaths; zero 
injuries; zero disparities; zero emissions; zero stress.  Within sections 3 & 4 we have laid out sample input, output, and outcome measures for each of the programs we have proposed.  Both these aspirational targets and program measures have emerged from the public engagement around the City’s transportation and climate action plans."

1QUESTION 1
Question 1:  Define your vision for your Smart City. Describe your city’s challenges and 
how the proposed elements of this proposed project can be used to address those challenges. The vision should define your approach for implementing and operating the demonstration project, including your program management approach. 
Background and Problem Statement
As one of the few regions in California that can still boast of relatively affordable housing and robust employment growth, the Sacramento region, in partnership with the federal government, has invested heavily in the creation of a light rail system capable of providing an economical and convenient transportation option for residents of the greater metropolitan area.  In similar fashion to the other 26 American cities with “true” light rail systems, Sacramento has struggled to increase light rail mode share, in major part, due to the “first mile/last mile” dilemma: while the light rail system provides an excellent regional transportation option, travelers who do not live and/or work close to a light rail station are significantly less likely to use the system (figure 1).  Instead travelers are prone to use private automobiles for their work and recreational transportation needs.  Sacramento Smart City Intelligent Transportation Project  
Vision Statement: 
 9Use next generation technologies to increase transportation choices, increase travel reliability, expand Light Rail service areas, reduce congestion, and lower the regional carbon footprint.
 9Provide a ladder of opportunity by increasing transportation choices in disadvantaged communities.
 9Show how these technologies and strategies are effective, and scalable for applications elsewhere in the United States.

UU99FUTURE ROADWAY CONGESTIONChallenge: Congested VMT and GHG Emissions
In the future, automotive users must compete for 
increasingly scant space on the regions’ roadway network.  Despite award-winning regional land use and transportation planning efforts, the City and region will suffer from increasing congestion.  Congested VMT, which produces some of the highest levels of GHG emissions is projected to increase over time.  Congested facilities will also reduce travel reliability.  As illustrated in Figure 2, by 2036, the Sacramento Metropolitan Transportation Plan (MTP) predicts that the majority of the regions’ arterials and mainline freeways will have significant segments on which the peak hour volume exceeds capacity.  Fuel consumption by vehicles driven in Sacramento is the single largest source of GHG emissions in the City, accounting for approximately 48 percent of the City’s total GHG emissions. Transportation is expected to contribute over 2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent annually by 2020.Public transit, especially light rail, can play an essential role in improving reliability and accessibility to destinations while minimizing GHG and air pollutant emissions.  The key is to find a way to expand the effective service area of LRT beyond the short ¼-mile walk to and from the stations desired by most riders.
Challenge: An Underutilized Light Rail System
With 40 miles of track and 54 stations, Sacramento’s LRT system offers a fantastic opportunity as a transportation alternative.  Presently, within the SACRT Service Area, approximately 10% of the regional population is within reasonable walking distance of light rail.  While the system experiences approximately 50,000 boardings per day currently (approximately 5% mode share), the average potential user’s origin or destination is more than 1/4-mile from the existing stations.  Enhancement of the first-mile/last-mile is key to increasing the utilization of the existing

system.  Coupled with longer-term infill 
development plans as described in the region’s Metropolitan Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy (MTP/SCS), enhancing the ability to better-access the light rail system is integral to maintaining regional mobility and achieving the region’s air quality conformity goals.
Challenge: Aging Infrastructure
Sacramento faces many of the same challenges most modern American Cities grapple with, including unfunded infrastructure maintenance burden.  In the City, the backlog for pavement maintenance alone is $150 million and growing.  Almost without exception, at the City, County, and State, level, QUESTION 1
Californians drive on deteriorating roadways with a perpetually growing maintenance backlog due to a structural transportation infrastructure funding deficit.  Also, the City’s traffic management infrastructure is largely based on 40+ year old technology with varying capabilities from one area to the next.
The City desires to address these issues by 
reducing VMT and the associated wear and tear on roadway.  There is also a strong need to implement “smart” traffic control infrastructure which helps to reduce congestion, give priority to transit, and set the stage for vehicle to infrastructure technology.
Challenge: Address Transportation  
Needs in Disadvantaged Communities
Almost 50% of all households in the City of Sacramento have low incomes, earning 80 percent or less of area median income. Nearly 16% of City households have extremely low-incomes, earning less than 30% of area median income.  The challenges faced by households with extremely low incomes are disproportionately felt among seniors (26%) and large families (30%).  In 2015, a large portion of the City of Sacramento was designated as a federal Promise Zone (figure 3).  For the population in the Promise Zone, the poverty and unemployment rates are 34.4% and 18.1%, respectively.
With the elimination of redevelopment 
agencies in California in 2012, there are few tools to help municipal government provide ladders of opportunity to their disadvantaged neighborhoods.  The City of Sacramento wishes to augment the public transportation system so that it becomes a viable tool to reach out beyond the immediate vicinity of existing LRT stations to provide convenient service to jobs, education, and medical care for the communities that need it the most.The average potential user’s  
origin or destination is more than

Project Introduction
In close collaboration with our partners, the 
City of Sacramento has envisioned a project that would meet the Smart City Challenge Goals of enhancing mobility and addressing climate change through the Sacramento Smart City Intelligent Transportation Project.  This project proposes to address the first mile/last mile transit usership gap, as well as meeting special use needs through a combination of Autonomous Electric Transit Vehicles (AETV’s), Partnerships with Transportation Network Companies (TNC’s), and smart sensor based traffic management infrastructure.
Proposed Project:
The proposed project has four key elements:
1. Autonomous Electric Transit Vehicles
2. Partnership with one or more TNC’s
3. Sacramento Smart City Transportation App
4. Smart Controllers
Key Element 1 - AETV
The City envisions a pilot phase, during which a fleet of AETV’s would be deployed to selected LRT stations where they would charge on inductive charging units. AETV’s would be owned and operated by SACRT.  The stations equipped with AETV’s would be carefully selected based on a service area which is most suitable for AETV operational support through fixed Vehicle to Infrastructure navigational/safety systems integrated into Smart Controllers (Smart Controllers are detailed below under “Key Element 4”).     
Autonomous vehicle manufacturers with 
whom the Sacramento team has been in contact have suggested that vehicles with the specifications the Sacramento Team is seeking  may cost anywhere from $150,000 to $350,000 each.  With 54 existing light rail stations, it will not be financially feasible to equip every station with AETV’s.
Financial considerations aside, initial AETV 
deployment to a small number of stations is preferrable.  Sacramento prefers to provide greater focus to a smaller fleet during the pilot phase. This focus will allow Sacramento to carefully monitor initial deployment to help ensure project success.  Pilot phase support will include:
 •A major public relations campaign which will not only advertise the availability of the expanded first mile/last mile service, but also to brand public transit as the preferred mode of transportation of the This Project Supports Sacramento’s Expressed Promise Zone Goals:

future.  In essence, “build 
a buzz” around our new and improved 21st century public transit model.
 •A ridership and performance measurement program conducted by University partners. (See response to Question 11)
 •In line with current California DMV standards, AETV’s will operate with an attendant on-board.  As autonomous vehicle standards mature and riders become more comfortable with the technology, Sacramento plans to remove attendants from the vehicles within 2 to 5 years as regulatory conditions allow.As the name implies, the AETV’s will be fully electric, further driving GHG emission reduction.  The project team includes the local electricity purveyor, the Sacramento Metropolitan Utility District (SMUD).  SMUD became the only large California utility to meet the statewide goal of supplying 20% of its power from renewables in 2010 and is well on its way to meeting the 2020 goal of 37%.  Hence, electric power from SMUD generates some of the lowest 
levels of GHGs in the country.  
Sacramento appreciates the responsibility and the opportunity to be one of the first local agencies in America to deploy autonomous vehicle technology as part of its public transit inventory.  The City has reflected this appreciation in our overall project vision statement: we will demonstrate that this QUESTION 1
The UC Davis Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS-Davis) is a project partner.  ITS-Davis hosts the National Center for Sustainable Transportation and has been actively involved in the research and development of electric, shared-ride, and autonomous vehicle technology for over 20 years.  Not only do they bring this wealth of expertise to the project, they have also worked extensively with most of the major auto manufacturers on a variety of R&D topics, including autonomous, electric, and shared-ride technologies.  These relationships provide direct access to the innovators at these companies with whom Sacramento can partner to bring these technologies into the mainstream and also help disseminate the technologies and lessons learned to other cities.
technology is a viable tool in 
our nation’s efforts to combat climate change and provide ladders of opportunity.  Sacramento aims to ensure that its pilot AETV program achieves that goal.Figure 4: Autonomous Electric Transit VehicleBEYOND TRAFFIC: THE SMART CITY CHALLENGE

Key Element 2 – TNC Partnerships
For light rail stations which are not initially 
equipped with AETV’s, Sacramento will still provide first mile/last mile light rail service through a Public Private Partnership with a TNC.  The model for this has already been proven to work in several U.S. Cities and is in the planning stages in several others.  The difference in user experience between the AETV service and the TNC service would be negligible, as both services would be actuated by the Sacramento Smart City Transportation App, and both services would provide the same amenity.
There are several advantages to utilizing a dual 
provider first mile/last mile service model.
 •TNC’s ensure that the entire system, not just AETV pilot areas, will benefit from first/last mile service.  This includes disadvantaged neighborhoods, where current transportation options are often limited by the lack of an automobile and/or inconvenient and/or circuitous bus service.  This addresses not only a purely functional issue, but also an issue of equity, as the existing light rail stations favor those who can pragmatically reach them, i.e., automobile owners. 
 •TNC’s offer a very flexible business model as they are typically deployed across a wide geographic area during most hours of the day.  This allows overflow capacity for periods of high usage such as the commute hour or during AETV maintenance cycles.  Without adding supplemental operations or labor costs, the first mile/last mile service can seamlessly accommodate fluctuations in user volume.  This is particularly important in Sacramento where the downtown LRT system serves the new Sacramento Kings Arena, Convention Center, and Community Center Theater.
 •Growing and supporting the shared economy is widely accepted as a fundamentally important tool in addressing many of challenges we face as a nation and beyond in the future.  By adding another facet in which people can be introduced to the shared economy, we move closer to our ultimate sustainability goals.
 •TNC’s are responsible for their own operations and maintenance costs, thereby reducing the burden on local government.
 •Creates economic opportunity as new jobs are created for growing TNC’s.
 •Sacramento believes that autonomous vehicle technology will play an important role in our society’s future one way or the other.  However, if the regulatory environment, public perception, or other barriers prevent AETV’s from being immediately successful, TNC service guarantee’s that the first mile/last mile problem still gets solved.
TNC POLICY ELEMENTS SACRAMENTO WILL CONSIDER:
 •Sacramento will evaluate a multiple provider system which would include “vouchers” for low income or disadvantaged community participants.  Such a system would allow all TNC’s to remain competitive on cost and quality of service.
 •Sacramento may give preferential treatment to TNC’s which can provide hybrid or electric vehicle service.7
QUESTION 1
The Sacramento MPO, SACOG, has 
recently introduced the “Connect Card” Program to simplify transit fare payment
Working with an existing transportation 
App provider such as Ridescout, Metropia, or Transloc, Sacramento would integrate the Connect Card program into a comprehensive region wide on-line/smart phone resource.Key Element 3 – Sacramento Smart City 
Transportation App
One of the major factors that has allowed 
TNC’s to thrive in the recent past is the revolutionary convenience with which they provide their service.  With the mere touch of a button on a phone, almost anyone, almost anywhere can get timely and economical transportation at almost any time.  On the other side of that coin, a common complaint with public transportation is the confusing and often non-intuitive process of route planning, as well as the inconvenience of fixed transit hubs.  The City of Sacramento’s proposed project would use the trail that has already been blazed by the TNC model to bring a new level of convenience to public transportation, and in doing so, begin to create new perceptions about public transit.
The City proposes to partner with one of the 
many private companies which have already developed on-line transportation planning applications to create a Sacramento specific app which will provide a “one-stop-shop” for transportation consumption.  The app would allow users to specify their desired trip origin and destination to within a few blocks and pay for that trip in one quick transaction.  That transaction would actuate first mile service from either an AETV or a TNC (depending on the user’s location), deliver the user to a light rail station for a light rail trip ending at a destination light rail station where last mile transportation service is already waiting.
This element can be incorporated with relative 
ease due to the availability of similar existing services and applications.  Also, the application development will be synergistic with the work that the local MPO, SACOG (Sacramento Area Council of Governments) has already done with the regional “Connect Card” program (see inset).
Key Element 4 – Smart Controllers
The final element of the City’s proposal may be the piece that goes the farthest in laying groundwork for Sacramento’s eventual transition into a true Smart City.  The City proposes to deploy new Smart Controllers which would not only provide real time traffic management, but also supplement autonomous vehicle systems, and provide urban analytics.

QUESTION 1
and the AETVs can also be 
equipped with cameras to provide ‘mobile’ real-time traffic views of operations, parking conditions, and traffic incidents.
AETV Special use Concepts:
In order to provide a wider range of opportunities to explore AETV use during the pilot phase, the City of Sacramento has identified several opportunities for “special uses” for AETV’s, or uses other than first mile/last mile transit service.  These possibilities will be explored in greater detail with our project partners if the City is fortunate enough to be invited by the U.S. DOT to submit a final Smart City Application during the next solicitation.
Special Event Shuttle 
Service:  Through a partnership with the National Basketball Association and the Sacramento Kings Professional Basketball team, the City is building a new sports and entertainment venue in downtown Sacramento: the Golden 1 Center.  In order to be efficient with space in the largely built out central business district, the Golden 1 Center plan does not include construction of a new parking facility. Instead, the City has Returning to the theme of taking every available avenue to ensure the success of nascent autonomous vehicle technology, Smart Controllers would initially be deployed on traffic signals in the vicinity of AETV equipped light rail stations in such a way that a network of quasi-fixed routes is established.  These quasi-fixed routes would be corridors that AETV’s could travel on in such a way that AETV’s are never out of Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) range from a Smart Controller.  In this way, the sensor based Smart Controllers act as a supplemental navigation system and an auxiliary safety feature in the event of a problem with AETV on-board autonomous navigation system.
In addition to the support 
for autonomous vehicle operation, Smart Controllers will also be designed to provide real time traffic management, transit system priority, and emergency vehicle pre-emption and communicate wirelessly with the City’s existing Traffic Operations Center (TOC).  The City also recognizes the value that the AETVs can offers as ‘sensors’ in the traffic stream.  Travel conditions from these sensors can be communicated to the TOC worked extensively with dozens of businesses which own parking facilities to develop special event parking agreements.  By coordinating the use of these private facilities and publicly owned facilities with a smartphone application, event goers are able to get directions to parking lots, get updates on which parking lots still have capacity, and even make reservations ahead of time for a parking spot.  AETV’s are envisioned to provide shuttle service to and from many of these parking facilities which are not located within convenient walking distance from the Center.  AETV’s may also be used to provide shuttle service to the Center staff parking lot, which is located several miles off site. 
A similar arrangement 
is under evaluation for Sacramento’s minor league professional soccer team the Republic FC.
Hospital Parking Shuttle 
Service:  Due to the existing high density development in the central business district, two major health care facilities have their campuses set apart from their parking facilities.

Urban Delivery:  One of 
the major areas of research focus for Sacramento Smart City team members in the UC Davis ITS group is urban delivery.  Sacramento’s central business district has significant need for urban delivery service due to the large number of retail and commercial businesses there that depend on logistics for their livelihood.  Its manageable size makes it the perfect test bed for an urban delivery pilot.  The City will be working with our UC Davis ITS partners to evaluate the feasibility of an urban delivery pilot program during phase 2 of the Smart City application process.11

Question 3:  Describe other characteristics of your city and show how it aligns with 
the USDOT’s characteristics for a Smart City, including:
Question 3a:  Existing public transportation systemSacramento Regional Transit District (SACRT) is the primary public transportation 
system in the City of Sacramento, and the largest of the eight public transit agencies in the region.  Established in 1973, SACRT operates over 60 bus routes which provide coverage for well over 400 square miles.  SACRT also operates the 14th busiest light rail system in America in terms of ridership with 14 million riders annually.  With over 40 miles of existing track and 54 stations, Sacramento’s light rail system provides the backbone of the region’s public transportation system.  
Question 3b:  Environment that is conducive to demonstrating proposed strategies
The proposed strategies are intended to complement the existing built 
environment in Sacramento, which already has a robust LRT system and a commitment to long-term (and award winning) smart growth strategies.  The complementary aspect of the proposed strategies will increase accessibility to destinations for tens of thousands of people through cost-effective public and private travel options that will minimize air pollutants and GHG emissions.  Many of BEYOND TRAFFIC: THE SMART CITY CHALLENGE

these people reside in Sacramento’s Promise 
Zone and are not able to fully engage in the local and regional economy because of their limited and high cost travel options.  
Examples of past success are listed below.
 •Sacramento displayed foresight and 
commitment to implement a light rail system in the first place.
 •Sacramento has successfully raised $110 million towards a streetcar project.
 •The Sacramento region has created and implemented the award-winning SACOG Blueprint, and in doing so, become a national model for smart growth transportation and land use planning (See figure 7).
 •The Sacramento Region provided the vision and led the way for the passage and implementation of California’s SB 375, which establishes GHG reduction targets for every metropolitan region in California.
 •Sacramento has adopted a general plan in compliance with SB 375 along with a Climate Action Plan to ensure the City maximizes the potential to reduced GHGs.
 •Rather than approach implementation of the $200 million in downtown transportation improvements in the MTP in a piecemeal fashion, Sacramento has initiated its “Grid 2.0” project, to plan for them all comprehensively. Through this effort, the City is exploring innovative new ideas in the use of our downtown transportation network (www.sacgrid.com). •SACOG is launching a joint Intelligent Transportation System Master Plan and ITS Architecture update for the City of Sacramento and the region in 2016.
 •Sacramento is home to Caltrans Headquarters, the California Air Resources Board (CARB), SACOG, University of California at Davis (UCD), and California State University at Sacramento (CSUS).  The synergy between these public agencies and academic institutions allows for a wide range of idea sharing.  This sharing contributes to unique outcomes not commonly found in other cities.RELEVANT STATE LEGISLATION:
Assembly Bill (AB) 32:  2007 Bill mandating the development of regulations and market mechanisms to reduce California’s GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.
Senate Bill (SB) 375: Landmark 2008 
law mandating that every metropolitan area in California establish target GHG emission reduction targets as part of its Metropolitan Transportation Plan.
SB 743: 2013 bill replaces vehicle level 
of service (LOS) with vehicle miles of travel (VMT) as the predominant metric for identifying transportation impacts.  The conventional use of vehicle LOS failed to demonstrate the benefits of urban infill and mixed-use development.  Further, LOS mitigation focused on expanding the roadway network, which only exacerbated current deficits for operations and maintenance.13
Question 3c:  Continuity of committed leadership and 
capacity to carry out the demonstration throughout the period of performance
For the purpose of the Smart City Challenge, the 
Sacramento Team defines “leadership” as the ability to push for innovative problem solving and nimble execution when faced with new challenges.  For decades, the State of California has shown extraordinary leadership in its approach to a variety of issues, not least of which is action on climate change and water conservation.  
Similarly, the City and region of Sacramento have 
shown great courage, foresight, and leadership in the implementation of several important initiatives.  For all of these, elected officials, regional planners, and transportation & transit officials have shown their ability to form a coalition and get big things done.  This commitment is as strong as ever for the Smart City Challenge proposal, which is endorsed by the Mayor and City Council of Sacramento, the Sacramento Area Council of Governments, the Sacramento Regional Transit District, and Caltrans.  Some relevant  examples of committed leadership are as follows: 
 •Sacramento agencies have shown continual land use, transportation, and environmental leadership demonstrated by creation of SACOG Blueprint and subsequent statewide legislation.
 -The success of the Blueprint led to statewide legislation such as California SB 375 that established GHG reduction targets for all metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs). 
 -SB 743 passed in 2013 replaces vehicle level of service (LOS) with vehicle miles of travel (VMT), easing regulatory barriers to in-fill smart growth projects. 
 -The City of Sacramento exempted its entire downtown from vehicle LOS requirements in 2005, streamlining the process for smart growth projects.
 •The region has a strong local commitment to transit as evidenced by the historical and planned transit allocations from Measure A, the local Sacramento County sales tax dedicated to transportation projects.  This tax was first approved by voters in 1989 and was recently extended for another 30 years in 2009.
 •The region’s commitment to leadership and local identity was recently evidenced by the effort to keep the NBA’s Sacramento Kings located in Sacramento after several attempts by other Cities to move the team.  The City, in partnership with the Kings organization and other regional partners, is building a downtown Arena directly on the LRT system and integrating mixed-use development directly into the project site to create a more robust 24-hour downtown environment.QUESTION 3
Figure 7BEYOND TRAFFIC: THE SMART CITY CHALLENGE

Question 3d:  A commitment to integrating 
with the sharing economy
Sacramento recognizes the benefit of the 
sharing economy and the ability for greater asset utilization.  The City recognized its role early in setting expectations as well as legal and regulatory frameworks to facilitate successful implementation of new services as outlined below.
 •Close coordination with TNC’s is a fundamental component of our proposal. Sacramento has long supported the operation of UBER and Lyft in the community.
 •The City recently created local ordinances which codify the legality and acceptance of both TNC’s and Airbnb, despite opposition from local private transportation providers and the local hotel industry.
 •Sacramento recently initiated a Bikeshare program that plans to open in 2017 with almost 90 stations and over 600 bikes.
 •Sacramento has been a host City for Zipcar since 2001. 
 •Sacramento is actively seeking grant funding to implement an electric car share program in collaboration with our private sector partner Car2Go (www.car2go.com)

Figure 9: ZipCar in Sacramento15
QUESTION 3
Question 3e:  A clear commitment to making 
open, machine-readable data accessible, discoverable and usable by the public to fuel entrepreneurship and innovation. 
The City of Sacramento’s commitment to open 
data is best demonstrated through its open data platform and portal, which allows users access to a substantial amount of data related to the physical aspects of the City as well as how it functions as a government agency.
The City’s open data portal already includes 
traffic count and collision records, and the City has ensured that API access is available to improve the ease of use by others.The City has a strong Public Records Act policy, which mandates disclosure of any public domain materials within 24 hours, free of charge.
This proposal will build on our open data 
platform through the City’s new state of the art Smart Controllers and use of the AETVs as mobile data sensors.  Instead of relying on manual traffic counts, future traffic studies will simply download data collected through the controllers and sensors.  Data will be organized, mapped, and stored for access through the City’s open data portal.  The City does not charge for data or require registration on the site to obtain data.  This information is available to anyone, anytime.

Question 5 (part 1);  Describe how your holistic, integrated approach aligns to the 
twelve USDOT vision elements described in this solicitation. For each vision element, 
describe your approach including the technology solutions proposed. 
intersection traffic management, transit system priority, emergency vehicle pre-emption, and wireless interconnect, integrated with autonomous vehicle safety and navigation capabilities on a platform which is easily upgradeable.  After the initial investment in deployment and support of AETV’s as part of this project, the City and region will continue to invest in Smart Controllers as part of its standard infrastructure.
Vision Element: Urban Analytics
Approach: Ease of implementing a robust urban analytics system is one of the many great benefits to the Sacramento proposal.  The Smart Controllers which will be deployed through this project will continuously collect traffic data and wirelessly transmit it back to a database in the City’s Traffic Operations Center.  Additional data can be harvested by the AETV’s themselves as they operate on the City’s roadway network.  The Sacramento Team also envisions utilizing the Smart City Transportation App to gather data.  As part of the public relations program, the Sacramento team is also considering soliciting voluntary region-wide participation from transit users and non-users alike in an app based mobility “share your data” program which would track travel patterns of participants.  While there are many uses for the mobility data gathered through these means, the primary project related goal is to be able to refine the first mile/last mile service over time.
5Vision Element: Urban Automation
Approach: The City of Sacramento/SACRT proposes to implement an autonomous transit vehicle to provide first mile/last mile LRT service.
Vision Element: Connected Vehicles
Approach: AETV’s will communicate with Smart Controllers and are also proposed to serve as shuttle service providers during special events in the downtown core.  Sacramento’s proposal includes vehicle to vehicle networking so that the vehicles can act as small “trains” when user demand requires it. 
Vision Element: Intelligent Infrastructure
Approach: This project will include Smart Controllers which provide automated real time 
CAL TRANS’  ROAD CHARGE 
PILOT PROGRAM:
The state of California has recently 
initiated a pilot program which will attempt to test a system of charging road users based on VMT, in order to ultimately replace the antiquated gas tax system which has left much of the nations roadways without sufficient maintenance funding.  Sacramento is reaching out to Caltrans to look for opportunities to use analytic technology to aid in this effort.BEYOND TRAFFIC: THE SMART CITY CHALLENGE
18
Vision Element: User Focused Mobility 
Services & Choices
Approach:  Providing user focused mobility 
services & choices is really what the City of Sacramento’s proposed project is all about.  The initiation of a first mile/last mile service in support of light rail will ultimately provide transportation options for many thousands of area residents who either don’t own cars now or would prefer not to in the future.  The Sacramento Smart City Transportation App will allow users to easily plan for and purchase their trips without requiring extensive knowledge of the location of transit stops, transfer stations, and timetables.  In essence, the Sacramento team has envisioned a project which truly acts as a springboard to bring the entire Sacramento region into the new shared economy.
Vision Element: Urban Delivery  
& Logistics
Approach:  As has been discussed previously under “AETV Special Uses” , the City of Sacramento and the UC Davis ITS research group are collaborating on the evaluation of an urban delivery pilot program for the Sacramento Central Business District.  This program would use AETV’s to provide logistics support for business in the downtown who utilize or plan to utilize just-in-time-delivery for inventory management, as well as other businesses who desire to explore this new 
paradigm. 
Vision Element: Strategic Business Models  
& Partnering
Approach:  The City of Sacramento has spent 
extensive time reaching out to potential partners as part of our effort to define the proposed project.  The City feels that the SACRAMENTO SMART CITY INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION PROJECT PARTNERS:

stations where AETV’s should be located and 
in which areas citizens would like to see them operate.
Vision Element: Architecture  
& Standards
Approach:  The desire to use the Sacramento Smart City Intelligent Transportation Project as a pilot whose elements are reproducible in other jurisdictions throughout the United States is reflected in the Sacramento Smart City Vision Statement, and has been at the core of the Sacramento Teams’ thinking from the beginning.  Throughout the proposed project, the Sacramento Team will adhere to CVRIA standards and National ITS Architecture in order to ensure that the project is scalable.  As was discussed previously under “Key Element 4 –Smart Controllers” , Sacramento envisions controllers which are easily maintained, repaired, and upgradeable, making them attractive for other markets.
 A unique 
advantage that the Sacramento Team offers is the deployment of an autonomous vehicle program which literally runs on the street in front of the State Capitol.  This offers an opportunity to allow lawmakers to see the program first hand, experience the vehicles and thereby become more comfortable with the technology.  Sacramento is confident that this “hands-on” opportunity, coupled with legislative advocacy, will act as a catalyst for more progressive and technology friendly standards for autonomous vehicles in California.
Vision Element: Low Cost, Efficient, Secure, 
Information & Communication Technology
Approach: The aim of the Sacramento 
project is to provide an efficient, low cost, and secure platform for Smart Controllers.  breadth and depth of the team that is forming around this effort is indicative of the regional excitement and commitment to making Sacramento a Smart City.  As has been discussed elsewhere in this proposal, the Sacramento Team plans to work with one or more TNCs in a public private partnership to expand first mile/last mile transit service beyond just the selected light rail stations which will initially be equipped with AETV units.  The model has the advantage of not only providing a catalytic effect on transit that the City and region desires, but also, it provides a private sector business opportunity. See question 7 for specific team member roles.
Vision Element: Smart Grid, Electrification, & 
Electric Vehicles
Approach:  As has been discussed elsewhere 
in this application, the Sacramento proposal includes autonomous electric vehicles, as well as inductive charging stations located at light rail stations.
Vision Element: Connected Involved Citizens
Approach:  The Sacramento Team is proposing an exciting and innovative new approach to expand transit service.  In order to help ensure its success, Sacramento proposes to launch a major public relations effort as one of the first steps in implementation.  The City’s vision is to re-brand transit as an exciting part of the new shared economy and a way all citizens can help to limit GHG emissions and combat climate change.  The Sacramento Smart City Transportation App will allow citizens to stay up to date by the minute with transportation options in their area, including traffic updates and real time tracking of transit vehicles.  As part of the AETV roll-out, the City will also use social media and on-line surveys to solicit public crowdsourcing feedback on BEYOND TRAFFIC: THE SMART CITY CHALLENGE
20
Smart Controllers utilize DSRC technology 
already, which is, by design, a secure methodology.  Sacramento will work with the USDOT to incorporate the security credential management system (SCMS) that is currently under development.
Vision Element: Smart Land Use
Approach: Implementation of the proposed project will vastly increase the land area which is available for transit oriented development.  With the increased distance from LRT stations that becomes accessible through this project, dense, in-fill, resource efficient land development need not only take place within a relatively small radius around light rail stations.  Question 5 (part 2):  Illustrate how the proposed technology solutions can synergistically combine to create measurable impact while reducing costs associated with both deployment and operations
The Sacramento proposal includes several innovative concepts which are almost certain to become the state of the practice in the foreseeable future, if not already.

QUESTION 5
Transportation planning apps have been 
prevalent for several years now.  Ride sharing, connected vehicles, and autonomous vehicles are already being deployed in many locations around the U.S.  Smart controllers which manage traffic in real time and also communicate with vehicles are deployed in experimental applications in many locations around the nation.  The synergy that the Sacramento proposal creates is in combining all of these new technologies to work together to show how they can combine to make a truly smart transportation system.
 •The project will operate in the capitol which makes Sacramento uniquely positioned to demonstrate the projects’ benefits, allows lawmakers to use the system, and inform the nascent regulatory dialogue about autonomous vehicle standards.
 •The project will allow the public to overcome fears about autonomous vehicles by introducing vehicles with on-board autonomous navigation systems, a human attendant, and stationary navigation systems in Smart Controllers. This three way safety net will encourage use by existing transit users, new transit users, and transit skeptics who are excited about autonomous technology. The synergy of removing fears, gaining political acceptance, and extending the effective transit service will result in a measurable increase in accessibility for many travelers along with a noticeable increase in transit mode share.
 •By folding TNC service into the menu of options for areas not served by AETV’s, much of the operations and maintenance costs for vehicles and labor are borne by private TNC’s.THE ECONOMIC CASE FOR INCREASING TRANSIT MODE SHARE
The average vehicle trip length for the City of Sacramento according to the California Household Travel Survey is approximately 7 miles.  For every vehicle trip that shifts to transit because of this proposal, the City will be avoiding approximately 7 pounds of CO2 equivalent GHG emissions .
According to APTA (http://www.apta.com/mediacenter/ptbenefits/Pages/default.aspx),
 •Every $1 invested in public transportation generates approximately $4 in economic returns.
 •Every $10 million in capital investment in public transportation yields $30 million in increased business sales.
 •Home  values performed 42 percent 
better on average if they were located near public transportation with high-frequency service.
These estimates are based on traditional transit services.  The City of Sacramento is offering an enhanced and more convenient service that will add a multiplier effect to these values.BEYOND TRAFFIC: THE SMART CITY CHALLENGE

Risk: O&M costs
Mitigation: First/last mile service can offset 
some lower performing conventional bus service.  Also, use of TNC’s in non-AETV areas will let the TNC’s be responsible for their own O&M costs.
Risk: Transit labor unions may resist “driverless” 
technology
Mitigation:  The labor pool no longer needed 
for conventional busses can be utilized on AETV’s and supporting core LRT service.
Risk: Public acceptance
Mitigation: Three tiered safety net (on-board 
navigation, on-board attendant, stationary roadside navigation).  Also, create a public relation / education campaign to generate a buzz.
Risk: Problems getting California regulations 
to catch up to autonomous vehicle technology
Mitigation: Use our geographical location as 
an advantage for demonstration of technology as well as lobbying and political advocacy.Risk: Overcoming public sentiment about more capital improvements instead of addressing “fix it first” commitments.  
Mitigation: “Smart” infrastructure could be 
the very thing that finally saves us from the never ending downward spiral of unfundable maintenance obligations because the focus isn’t to keep building more asphalt. Rather, the focus is to use existing asphalt more efficiently. Also, increased ridership helps support greater efficiency/cost-effectiveness in the transit system and greater support for a state of good repair.Question 6:  Identify and rate key technical, policy, and institutional risks associated with the deployment vision and discuss plans for mitigating those risks.

Question 8b:  Freeway miles
1,622 (lane miles)
Question 8c:  Transit services
See response to question “3a” on page 11.
Question 8d:  Shared-use mobility services  
See response to question “3d” on page 14.  
The City has business franchises for ZipCar, Lyft, and Uber, and is developing a bikeshare program in partnership with SACOG and other jurisdictions.
Question 8e:  Information and communication 
technology (ICT) 
Sacramento has recently conducted its “5-Bar” 
study to assess the feasibility of providing City-wide Wi-Fi service.  Expanding access to city services to anyone, anytime, anywhere (responsive, accessible, and mobile) is a primary mission of the City’s Digital Strategy.  In addition to existing TOC facilities (see Question 8f ); the City also has 150 miles of conduit, two data centers, and over 100 miles of fiber optic cable.  The cost of investment in small cells, ODAS, and Wi-Fi are very low right now while construction of the Golden 1 Center is underway and the City is poised to launch a new generation of communications technology.Question 8f:  Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) including transportation management centers and field equipment
The City has worked hard on the 
implementation of Traffic operation Center (TOC), traffic communication network and an Advance Traffic Management System (ATMS) for Central Traffic Control to optimizing the existing roadway system, manually change timing, and manage incidents. 
The Traffic Operations Center is located in 
City Hall and utilizes Transcore, a computer-based ATMS traffic signal control system which monitors traffic conditions and system performance.  The TOC also uses closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance equipment deployed at critical locations throughout the City to monitor traffic conditions. The City has installed CCTV cameras at 98 locations and new sites are being added.  The City operates over 780 signalized intersections of which 430 are currently connected to central traffic control system.

8Question 8:  Describe existing transportation infrastructure and system features in 
your city, including:
Question 8a:  Arterial miles
10,863 (lane miles)25
QUESTION 9
Question 9 (part 1):  Define the data your city currently collects. Describe how these 
data, along with new data to be collected and shared during the demonstration may be used by the lead agency, project partners, other agencies and stakeholders to further address city challenges.
In addition to the information presented previously; the City and our partners 
collect a wide range of existing transportation network and use data across all modes with routine sharing through websites and our open data portal.  Sacramento also partners with private firms that use ‘big data’ to help understand travel patterns as part of transportation planning and impact analysis.  For example, The City used cell phone and mobile device data to estimate arrival and departure patterns for Sacramento Kings and Republic FC games as part of analyzing new arena locations.  This experience with mobile device data has helped define this proposal such that Sacramento recognizes that smart phones and AETV’s are mobile sensors that can provide data to help refine future service.
Question 9 (part 2): Describe how transportation data could integrate with other 
functions or services in a city (such as public safety, human services, transit, and public works) to improve the management and operations of the city. 
Traffic data collected through the systems described in this proposal could be 
used for a variety of purposes.  Both publicly funded capital improvement projects as well as private development projects require time consuming and resource intensive traffic studies as part of their environmental clearance.  Data collected through the proposed project could eliminate the need for these studies and greatly reduce the costs and schedule impacts associated with the regulatory process.

9Question 8g:  Smart Grid 
infrastructure including electric vehicle charging infrastructure
The City currently has 48 
public charging stations located at City owned parking structures.  Additionally, there are 3 sites in the City which are used to charge electric vehicles in the City’s fleet.
Figure 16: City of Sacramento Electric Vehicle ParkingBEYOND TRAFFIC: THE SMART CITY CHALLENGE

The City of Sacramento and Sacramento County co-operate a regional Emergency 
Operations Center (EOC) which maintains a state of readiness in the event of a major regional emergency such as a flood, major hazardous material spill, terror attack, etc.  The type of information gathering network envisioned with the next generation Smart Controllers would be invaluable for decision makers operating at the EOC during a regional emergency.
It may be possible to utilize the elements described in this proposal in law 
enforcement applications including incident management.  However, such applications will need to be carefully vetted against privacy policies.
The information gathered as part of this project, in conjunction with crowdsourcing 
feedback, will be useful in optimizing transit routes and timetables.
Question 9 (part 3):  Likewise, describe how other data could be integrated with 
transportation data to improve transportation operations.
AETVs can be equipped with cameras that can provide mobile probes of traffic 
operating conditions, which can contribute to incident and parking management as well as law enforcement activities.
Question 9 (part 4):  Describe any existing policies and identify their sources (local 
executive order or policy, local ordinance or state legislation, etc.) applicable to the proposed data to be collected and shared as part of the proposed project.
VMT measurement and monitoring are required at the State, regional, and local 
level in California due to laws such AB 32, SB 375, and SB 743.  Understanding how the proposed service changes VMT could result in this new service being qualified as a mitigation action that new development could contribute towards through the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).  The proposal includes the ability to use sensors and user’s smart phone app data to capture VMT effects.
Question 9 (part 5): Submissions describing cross-cutting partnerships to advance 
smart city technologies, related programs and policies are encouraged, but not required. If you plan to partner with outside organizations (nonprofits, universities, corporations, etc.) you should address whether and specify how (e.g., limitation on sharing or use) data from those organizations or interests will be collected, managed, and shared across sectors or with the public, if appropriate
The City’s goal of developing a model to address first mile/last mile transit issues 
is reflected in the project Vision Statement.  Sacramento already has a very strong citywide policy on dissemination of public records in accordance with the Public Records Act.  Any non-proprietary, non-confidential material produced or paid for by the City is made available to anyone who files a Public Records Act Request within 24 hours.  The City already makes on-line records of all traffic counts in its possession.27
QUESTION 9
The project will work with one of our academic partners to produce an annual 
monitoring report through the pilot phase of the project, and possibly beyond, depending on availability of funding.  The report will be made available to the public through the City’s website. 
Question 9 (part 6):  Identify candidate data that is expected to be shared, used, and 
used for other purposes by the participating project partners or with the public.
The City of Sacramento has a strong culture of transparency.  As is reflected in our 
vision statement for this project, the goal is to create systems and standards which will serve as a nationwide model for first mile/last mile transit service, allowing cities across America to work together towards our mutual goal of reducing traffic congestion and GHG emission, thereby avoiding the grim predictions of the U.S. DOT’s “2045” study.  The City of Sacramento will make available any information that comes out of the project which is not protected under a private intellectual property arrangement (see previous response).  Information which will be publicly available will include, but not be limited to transit ridership, mode share, real time transit vehicle location, bike share availability, traffic volumes, GHG offsets, project capital and O&M costs, and the annual monitoring report.
Question 9 (part 7):  Describe the terms and conditions that exist or will be 
established and managed in partnership agreements, data or information sharing agreements, agency specific policies and operating procedures to establish and maintain the systems and interfaces to maintain the integrity of the data and share the information identified in the proposal 
Vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure data exchanges will be encrypted 
and follow strict protocol, typical of DSRC.   Data transfer sessions will be in short 
bursts to minimize hacking opportunities.   Each data exchange party will   be 
assigned a random ID that will be purged at the end of each session, so there is 
no link to individuals, vehicles, or agencies for hackers to mine.   These are proven 
strategies that have protected electronic toll collection systems from hacking for 
many years.
Data sharing among partner agencies will be in synthesized forms such as volume, 
speed, dynamic, and trend, posted on private, password protected website.   There 
is absolutely no personal data of any kind that may attract criminal activity.BEYOND TRAFFIC: THE SMART CITY CHALLENGE

11Question 11:  Provide measurable goals and objectives for your vision and 
describe your approach for monitoring the impact of the demonstration on 
mobility, safety, efficiency, sustainability, and climate change.  
Performance measures will be used throughout the planning and 
implementation phases.  For planning purposes, the Sacramento Team has drafted the following proposed project goals:
 •Achieve a measurable increase in light rail ridership
 •Achieve a measurable reduction in VMT
 •Work with SACOG to integrate project elements into regional ITS master plan
 •Use program as a demonstration for the California state legislature with the objective of pressing for more progressive autonomous vehicle standards and avenues to incentivize electric vehicles & the infrastructure to charge them
 •Generate analytic data to support the utility of the program in order to promote pilot projects in other cities
 •Operate AETV’s with a better accident rate than the regional average for similar facilities
 •Through pre- and post- program user surveys, enhance the public image of light rail/transit systemQuestion 10:  Describe your approach for using existing standards, architectures, and certification processes for ITS and connected vehicle based technologies and plans for documenting experiences and cooperating with architecture and standards developers to improve the quality of these products based on lessons learned in deployment.
Sacramento will adhere to the national ITS architecture, which is also the 
standard on which SACOG will be basing all of its regional ITS infrastructure deployment.  As stated previously, AETV program design will be in accordance with CVRIA standards, as well as upcoming FHWA Connected Vehicle infrastructure deployment guidance (http://www.its.dot.gov/meetings/pdf/V2I_DeploymentGuidanceDraftv9.pdf ).

experience includes the 
delivery of a $100 million interchange on Interstate 5 and a current project to construct a federally funded $80 million moveable bridge across the Sacramento River.  SACRT has recently completed a major light rail extension project and is in the process of preparing an environmental document for a multimodal bridge over the American River.  In addition, the City is a partner in the delivery of the new $500 million Golden 1 Center sports and entertainment venue, which is on track to meet the NBA’s aggressive opening day schedule.
Executive Commitment

Large Project Experience
The City of Sacramento prides itself on its ability to take on large, complex, federally funded projects.  The City of Sacramento has delivered over $1 billion dollars in federal projects over the last 20 years with regular FHWA audits demonstrating efficient value-add project delivery acumen.  Recent project BEYOND TRAFFIC: THE SMART CITY CHALLENGE

13Question 13: Describe any opportunities to leverage Federal resources through 
cost share, in-kind donations, and partnering.
This project will involve sizable in-kind labor contributions from all partners.  
Significant economic stimulus effects are likely to result with the introduction of the first autonomous transit vehicles in California.  Providing a model for first mile/last mile solution which is easily scalable through TNC partnership may open up significantly increased ridership on light rail systems around the U.S., which again, are constructed with large amounts of federal funds.the planning of a new streetcar system are examples.  More broadly, the creation and implementation of the Blueprint smart growth policy and subsequent sponsorship and implementation of SB 375 stand as testament to courageous and progressive policy making.  These initiatives were driven at the executive level and have become the gold standard for smart growth land use policy in California and beyond.
Workforce Resources
One of the advantageous aspects of the Sacramento proposal is that it does not propose a new program which will require a significant increase in operations or labor costs.  The traffic operations center, the private TNC community, and the light rail system are all currently up and running.  The proposed project will dovetail with these existing systems to make them more user friendly and efficient without requiring significant extra workforce.Infrastructure Readiness
The City already has a light rail system and operator, and a TOC with an extensive fiber based interconnect system.  Transit pre-emption is already standard operating procedure for the City.  The City of Sacramento’s infrastructure is ready for implementation of this project.
Data and Performance  
Management Capabilities
The City of Sacramento has been actively engaged in the California multi-agency benchmarking study since its inception in 2002 (http://eng.lacity.org/techdocs/cabm/).  This is a collaboration between the seven largest cities in California to continuously measure our project delivery performance against industry standards to ensure public value.  This process has not only proven to be an invaluable tool for our own performance management, but also for our ability to handle large volumes of project delivery data and boil it down into useful information."

SMART CITY CHALLENGE GRANT APPLICATION 1 
INTRODUCTION  
The City of Richmond, Virginia, along with a strong coalition o f public and private partners, is 
requesting consideration by the U.S. Department of Transportati on (USDOT) to be among the five 
finalists for Beyond Traffic: The Smart City Challenge. Project  partners believe Richmond is 
uniquely positioned to meet this challenge and exceed all expec tations in demonstrating a 
successful, holistic, and integrated approach to improving tran sportation in communities of similar 
size and complexity. Richmond is geographically distinct, not e mbedded in a complex of 
metropolitan areas, which better suits it to serve as a model S mart City.  
Our proposed approach will deploy cutting edge transportation s olutions by integrating emerging 
transportation data, technologies, and applications with existi ng systems to address our most 
pressing social and environmental challenges and demonstrate th eir efficacy. Equally important is 
that Richmond’s diverse attributes are likely to make Richmond’ s proposed strategies broadly 
transferable to other mid-size U.S. cities. With its rich and, in important respects, painful history, 
Smart City designation will provide an opportunity to demonstra te how innovative techniques can 
address difficult historical legacies in any city that contends  with them.  
In the following sections we pr esent our vision of Richmond’s S mart City Future, describe key 
problems and needs of our residents that have resulted from pas t inequitable transportation and 
land use decisions, describe the current transportation landsca pe, and how our proposed Smart City 
demonstrations will fill the gap between the needs of our resid ents and the shortcomings of our 
current systems. In doing so, we will evidence our readiness to  conduct and carryout our proposed 
demonstrations and why Richmond is an excellent location for th em. To this end we have a 13th 
Vision Element called Health Mobility.  
Much of the information presented in this proposal is, technica l, or descriptive. To 
provide a more human-level perspective of what the information means for people living 
in Richmond, a series of short vi gnettes can be found in variou s parts of the proposal. 
The vignettes will present a family that is representative of t ransportation-disadvantaged families 
living in Richmond’s more challenged neighborhoods. This family , the Smiths, consist of Jan, 
James, and their 12 year old daughter, Kari. The symbol to the above left represents our 13th vision 
element, Healthy Mobility, and will accompany each of the Smith  vignettes.  
1. VISION 
In the Smart City, state-of-the-art technology promotes mobilit y that is safe, conducive to public 
health, efficient in its use of space and energy, sustainable, and affordable to all. A Smart City is 
also a livable city, bridging gaps between people and places fo r economic and social benefits and 
improving well-being, equity, and health. 
Richmond envisions itself as a Smart City in which state-of-the -art mobility technology equitably 
and noninvasively serves commerce, commuters, and local residen ts. Our city street network has 
an excellent grid system, but si ngle occupant vehicle travel is  the norm. In our Smart City future, 
walking and bicycling will be normal mobility modes operating i n harmony with powered mobility 
systems. New technology will be a n indispensable means to this end, but will not be mistaken for 
an end in itself. In its Smart City future, Richmond will conti nue to value and measure traffic safety 
and traffic volume, but livability, sustainability, health, and  well-being will also continue to be 
heavily factored into planning d ecisions as guiding principles.   
 
 
SMART CITY CHALLENGE GRANT APPLICATION 2 
Although Richmond is currently challenged by the dominance of a utomobile traffic, our Smart 
City future will not require residents to own or operate a moto r vehicle in order to access job 
opportunities. As one in four city residents lives below the po verty level, compared to 
approximately one in ten throughout Virginia,1 Richmond must offer more reliable, extensive, and 
affordable transportation to better serve its low-income reside nts. Indeed, one step out of poverty 
is relief from the expensive necessity of owning a car. Richmon d will use vehicle automation 
technology to improve multimodal access to jobs and economic de velopment in a way that 
promotes healthy and safe stree ts and personal and physical wel lbeing. 
The Richmond metropolitan area has been ranked as the third mos t obese “major U.S. community” 
according to a Gallup poll.2 Almost 30 percent of metropolitan  area residents are obese. In  our 
Smart City future, Richmond will help cut that percentage signi ficantly by creating an environment 
that is conducive to active transportation.  
Finally, new technologies will enable safer, more efficient, an d more enjoyable interactions among 
users of different modes of transportation. Existing and new te chnologies capture data that, with 
proper analysis, can yield unexpected opportunities for further  improvement of life in the city. 
Analysis, learning, and innovation based on real data are at th e core of a Smart City. Richmond 
will capture, retain, and disseminate the copious data produced  to inform local, state, and national 
assessments and future program development and strategic planni ng. 
2. POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS   
Richmond had a 2010 land area of 59.81 square miles and a popul ation of 204,214, resulting in a 
population density of 3,414.7 persons per square mile.3 Richmond represents the densely settled 
core Census-Designated Place (CDP) of the Richmond Census Urban ized Area (UZA). The 
Richmond UZA had a 2010 land area of 492.17 square miles and a population of 953,556, resulting 
in a population density of 1,937.5 persons per square mile.4  Richmond accounts for 12.2% of the 
Richmond UZA land area (59.81 square miles divided by 492.17 sq uare miles) and 21.4% of its 
population (Richmond’s population of 2014,214 divided by the UZ A population of 953,556). 
However, in addition to meeting the population attributes of a Smart City, Richmond’s Smart City 
vision has been shaped significan tly by past tra nsportation and  land use decisions and their role in 
current socioeconomic realities citywide.  
Concentration of poverty within  a neighborhood is a strong indi cator of lack of employment 
opportunities and other supports, and, as is evident from the m ap on page 11, poverty in Richmond 
is clustered heavily in neighborhood s in the East, North, and S outh sides of the city. In Richmond, 
25.6% of residents live in poverty, more than double that of Vi rginia (11.3%) and over one-third 
more than nationally (15.4%). For children it is even more acut e: 38.8% for Richmond, 14.9% for 
Virginia, and 21.6% nationally.  The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 
maintains data estimating the number of people who are identifi ed as low- and moderate-income 
(LMI), based on incomes that are less than 80% of the area medi an income. In Richmond’s East 
End, 81.3% of the population is categorized as LMI. This is a h igher than the city’s overall rate of

61.2%, which places Richmond within the bottom 7% of localities  nationwide in terms of having 
the most disproportionate LMI rates.5 The working poor, who hover just above the poverty 
threshold, fall within this category and are at constant risk o f falling into poverty. 
Quality housing, public safety, and proximity to medical care a re also essential to thriving for 
individuals and communities. One such area in Richmond is its E ast End, which is characterized 
by aging public housing facilities as well as extensive abandon ed, vacant, and blighted properties 
that contribute to high crime rates and poor health. In additio n, all five Census Tracts within East 
End are designated as Health Profession Shortage Areas (more th an 3,500 people per 1 primary 
care physician), and three Census Tracts are designated as Medi cally Underserved Areas. The 
proposed East End also falls within a USDA-recognized Food Dese rt, as residents must travel 
more than one mile in order to reach a grocery store.  
The Smiths live in a neighborhood with few parks but with many abandoned buildings 
and high levels of crime. The majority of neighborhood families  have incomes below the 
federal poverty level, and most adults have not continued educa tion beyond high school. 
This is the part of town that was historically redlined, result ing in the segregation of African 
Americans into under resourced, high poverty communities. The S mith family home is a rental 
unit, modest in size and located two blocks from one of Richmon d’s public housing communities. 
There are a few fast food restaurants and liquor stores in thei r neighborhood, but no full service 
grocery stores. Among other things, tobacco and alcohol are mar keted disproportionately in the 
community, compared to communities with less poverty and fewer residents of color. In addition, 
tobacco and alcohol are easier to obtain than fresh fruits and vegetables and low fat foods. 
These challenging social, health, and environmental issues are part of a legacy of damaging state- 
and federally-sponsored public pro jects and have been exacerbat ed by poor local land use and 
planning decisions. Historically , Richmond’s East End was part of the Jackson Ward 
neighborhood, a thriving African-American commercial and reside ntial area after the Civil War 
and home to many internationally notable citizens and celebriti es. Nicknamed both “Black Wall 
Street” and “the Harlem of the South” by southerners, Jackson Ward was an important cultural destination for African-Americans throughout the early 20th century.
 The district is 
also historically significant because it was central to the Civil Rights movement in Richmond. In 1955, prior to the creation of the U.S. Interstate Highway System, the Virginia General Assembly created the Richmond–Petersburg Turnpike Authority as an independent state agency which constructed a new Turnpike of the same name. The Turnpike bisected the Jackson Ward neighborhood, resulting in devastating, irreparable effects on its fabric. Within a month of its opening in 1958, the State Highway Commission designated it as part of Interstate 95.

From the early 1940s through 1970, six public housing communiti es were constructed in the 
eastern bisected area, totali ng 2,639 housing units within a tw o square mile area and resulting the 
highest concentrations of public housing between New York City and Atlanta. In the 1970s, 
construction of Interstate 64 cr eated a barrier, further isolat ing geographically the eastern bisected 
area and Richmond’s public housing, now the East End, from the rest of the city and neighboring 
Henrico County. Exacerbated by poor local land use decisions, t hese State- and federally-
supported public housing and tran sportation projects reduced Ja ckson Ward from a nationally-
recognized African-American cultu ral and financial center to se parate neighborhoods of poverty, 
crime, and blight. Today, the city’s East End public housing co mmunities represent the greatest 
geographic concentration of pove rty within the entire Richmond Urbanized Area. The population 
of this area remains geographically isolated and lacks transpor tation options to connect to job sites 
and amenities in other parts of the city and surrounding jurisd i c t i o n s .  G i v e n  t h e s e  f a c t o r s ,  
addressing key problems in Richmond’s East End will be a primar y focus of our Smart City 
strategy.  
The Smiths always eat breakfast together before going their sep arate ways for the day.  
After breakfast, Kari asks her father for help with some finish ing touches on a project 
for school. Mr. Smith helps her g ladly, but now he’s running la te for his bus. He sprints 
to the bus stop to make up the lost minutes, only to watch the back end of the bus disappear down 
the road. The next bus doesn’t c ome for another half hour. He p aces and waits, knowing he’ll lose 
half an hour of pay and that his lateness will be recorded in h is personnel file. Mr. Smith supports 
his family on his single hourly income, with the additional hel p of government assistance; there 
are jobs out in Henrico and Chesterfield counties that pay bett er, but he would need a car to get to 
them, and there’s no way to save up for a car on the amount of money he makes now. Mr. Smith 
calls his supervisor and apologi zes for missing the bus, leavin g out the part where he chose being 
a present father over being on time – he knows his supervisor i s indifferent to this point. 
3. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS 
Richmond is well aligned with the USDOT’s characteristics for a  Smart City, including its existing 
public transportation system, environment, committed leadership , commitment to open data, 
diverse, sustainable, and healthy mobility, and integrating the  sharing economy. Additionally, 
Richmond has a long history of transportation innovation, a com mitment to diverse, sustainable, 
and healthy mobility, and a commi tment to creating wealth and f ighting poverty. 
Existing Public Transportation System 
Greater Richmond Transit Company (GRTC): Founded in 1860, the p ublic transit system known 
today as GRTC has operated continuously, with one temporary suspension o f service during the 
Civil War, for over 150 years. GRTC’s history of being a progre ssive transit system was 
established when it was the first public transit agency to impl ement the system wide use of electric 
streetcars. That progressive att itude carries forth to today, w ith service improvements and 
additions such as expanded services for seniors and individuals  with disabilities, welfare-to-work 
transportation, vanpool and carpool  development, regional taxic ab oversight, and expanded 
service to surrounding counties a nd cities. Jointly owned by th e City of Richmond and Chesterfield 
County, the transit agency was purchased from private owners an d incorporated as GRTC Transit 
System, on April 12, 1973, for the purpose of providing public transportation service in the Greater 
Richmond area. Today, GRTC primarily serves Richmond and a very  small portion of the adjacent 
counties of Henrico and Chesterfield. 
 
 
SMART CITY CHALLENGE GRANT APPLICATION 5 
In general, service is concentrated in the City, where many hou seholds and residents are 
characterized as being in need o f transit based on demographics . Transit-dependent factors include: 
living below the poverty line, having a mobility limitation, be ing aged 65 or older, and having 
either no, or only one vehicle available. Residents falling int o these categories typically have 
difficulty accessing major destinations, such as medical facili ties, government facilities and 
services, employment centers, as  well as grocery and other reta il outlets, without  adequate public 
transportation services. On-board surveys of GRTC users reveal that only about half have access 
to a vehicle; about half do not possess a valid driver’s licens e; 41% of riders have annual household 
incomes of less than $15,000; over 71% use GRTC services four o r more days per week;  86% 
live within the geographic limits of the city; and 72% self-ide ntify as African-American.6 
Unfortunately, many of Richmond’s most transportation-  disadvantaged households must rely on 
transferring from bus to bus multiple times to access job sites , medical offices, and healthy food 
shopping locations and in many poor neighborhoods buses arrivin g at stops are infrequent  
Mrs. Smith takes the bus to a grocery store five miles from her  house twice a month, 
buying the most groceries at the start of the month when she re ceives her family’s SNAP 
benefits. It takes her about an hour to get there, as she has t o switch bus lines halfway 
through. She buys as many canned and boxed foods as she can car ry and a few pieces of fruit, but 
only as many as she knows Kari w ill eat before they go bad and waste money.  
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT): The Broad Street BRT, known as the “Pu lse,” is a 7.6 mile long project 
that will provide city residents with faster, more convenient a ccess to growth areas in surrounding 
Henrico County. The Pulse is a regional collaboration between G RTC, the Virginia Department 
of Rail and Public Transportatio n (DRPT), City of Richmond and Henrico County. With 14 
stations and dedicated BRT lanes, the “Pulse” will improve tran sit service, increase livability, 
enhance economic opportunity, rev italize commercial properties,  improve environmental 
sustainability, and stimulate economic development in the city and greater Richmond region. The 
Pulse has received a $24.9M grant from the USDOT TIGER program.  The hallmark of the Pulse 
is its ability to provide safer, more reliable transportation b y having dedicated lanes and transit 
signal priority (TSP) throughout the corridor. BRT transit serv ice operations and on-time 
performance are fundamentally dependent on successful implement ation of the TSP technology 
and communication between the BRT vehicle and traffic signals. The Pulse will also have real 
time next bus arrival information at each station to offer ride rs accurate minute-by-minute 
information. The Pulse project is being implemented through a d esign-build process and is 
currently in the procurement pha se, with anticipated operation by October 2017. As an adjunct to 
the Pulse project, the City is c onducting a study to determine how best to connect East End 
communities to Pulse stations. This process will become part of  the full Smart City proposal should 
the City be selected as one of the five finalists. 
High Speed Rail - DC2RVA: The Federal Railroad Administration ( FRA) and the Virginia 
Department of Rail and Public Transportation (DRPT) are conduct ing a Tier II Environmental 
Impact Statement for High Speed  Rail between Richmond and Washi ngton D.C. (aka DC2RVA). 
The Tier II EIS will lead to a decision on advancing the High S peed Rail recommendations for a 
third track. The City has invested in historic Main Street Stat ion which serves as the City’s

multimodal transportation hub and will be the City’s High Speed  Rail station.   
Environment Conducive to Demonstrating Proposed Strategies 
Richmond’s diverse physical envi ronment makes it an ideal candi date as a Smart City. Lying on 
the fall line of the James River, where Virginia’s coastal Tide water region meets the rolling terrain 
of the Piedmont, Richmond combines topographical attributes of coastal and floodplain cities and 
those more typical of the inland. Originally built on seven hil ls on the north side of the fall line of 
the James, Richmond now spreads over both banks of the river, e ncompassing very steep grades 
to the north and flat terrain to the south, a combination that provides excellent topographical 
diversity for demonstrating emer ging transportation solutions. 
A mid-Atlantic city, Richmond has four distinct seasons with wi de fluctuations in temperature, 
humidity, and precipitation thr ough the year. Hence, successful  efforts to promote walkability, 
cycling, and other active mobility must take into account extre mes of weather. 
Richmond’s transportation milieu, a mix of nineteenth-century s treet grids, urban arterials, and 
interstate highways, make it typical of mid-sized cities nation wide. However, Richmond is unique 
in that it owns the Port of Richm ond which is the western termi nus for commercial navigation on 
the James River and is Central Virginia’s domestic and internat ional multi-modal freight and 
distribution center, serving wate rborne, rail and truck shipper s throughout the Mid-Atlantic States.  
Richmond has a diverse cultural and economic environment: it em bodies attributes of aging 
industrial cities with those of growing Sunbelt cities; its pop ulation is socioeconomically and 
demographically diverse; its existing transportation infrastruc ture, including the regional transit 
systems, is typical of comparable cities; it has areas that are  distressed, affluent, and gentrified; 
has significant and growing peri pheral sprawl; and a challengin g set of social, health, and 
environmental issues.  
On the off weeks, if the Smiths need groceries, Mrs. Smith walk s down to the corner 
store, where they accept her SNAP card but prices are as much a s 50% higher than at a 
regular grocery store and they al most never carry fresh fruits or vegetables. The coolers 
at the corner stores are stocked with more alcohol than soft dr inks or dairy; Mrs. Smith doesn’t 
drink much, but on her way home with a bag of groceries, she wi ll pass two other places to buy 
beer and wine and encounter plent y of her neighbors who are out  of the workforce and drinking 
during the day. She heads back i nto the house and watches telev ision and waits for Kari and 
James to come home.   
Continuity of Committed Leadership and Capacity to Carry Out th e Demonstration  
Richmond’s Smart City Challenge proposal has the full, committe d support elected leadership as 
evidenced by Mayor Dwight C. Jones’ strong letter of transmitta l. The Richmond City Council has 
also expressed support and intends to act on a resolution expre ssing that support, which is being 
sponsored by both the Mayor and members of the City Council. Th e resolution was to have been 
acted upon in time for inclusion in this proposal during Januar y 25, 2016 City Council meeting, 
but the meeting was canceled due to a major winter storm that p aralyzed the city. Richmond’s 
elected leadership understand th at Richmond is in a unique tran sformational period and believe 
designation as the selected Smart City will help propel the tra nsformation of the community.  
In addition, City department head s and other high-level adminis trators represent a strong cadre of 
 
 
SMART CITY CHALLENGE GRANT APPLICATION 7 
support for Richmond’s Smart City proposal and the cutting edge  projects it contains. Many of 
these non-elected leaders have l ong tenures with the City which  will continue beyond the Smart 
City Challenge performance period; the committed support of the se non-elected leaders will serve 
to champion Smart City initiatives throughout the performance p eriod. 
Finally, the commitment of other Community leaders and project partners, as evidenced by the 
included letters of support and commitment, reinforce that of e lected officials and high-level 
administrators. The expertise of  our partnering organizations a nd the governance structure 
proposed to oversee the Smart City Program will also help lever age the City’s significant capacity 
to undertake the demonstration throughout the performance perio d and bring the associated 
initiatives and their evaluation to fruition.  
When Kari is sick, Mrs. Smith must walk to school to meet her, walk with her to the bus 
stop, and take two different buses to reach the closest clinic that accepts her health 
insurance plan. The long, overcrowded bus ride always makes Kar i feel sicker, and the 
ride home, with a third stop at a pharmacy since there is not o ne within walking distance of their 
house, feels even longer. Kari’s father never takes time off fr om work to go to the doctor even if 
he is sick, because an hour of missed work is an hour of missed  pay, something the Smiths can’t  
Commitment to Integrating with the Sharing Economy 
The City has committed to integrating with the sharing economy as evidenced in both formal 
planning documents and ongoing procurement activity. The City u nveiled its sustainability plan, 
RVAgreen, to improve the quality of life for residents, create a healthy environment, and enhance 
economic opportunity. The RVAgreen Plan was developed under the  Mayor’s Green Government 
Order and has been formally adopted by City Council. The RVAgre en Plan includes an initiative 
to implement a Bike Share program in the City  as an important element in reducing its carbon 
footprint via a reduction of citywide Vehicle-Miles-Traveled (V MT) per capita,7 a s  w e l l  a s  a  
method to increase access to transportation for all residents, including those who are 
transportation-disadvantaged. Implementation of the Bike Share Project is currently in progress; a 
vendor has been selected and awarded by the Richmond Department  of Procurement Services on 
February 1, 2016.  
Clear Commitment to Making Open, Machine-Readable Data Accessib le, Discoverable and 
Usable by the Public to Fuel Entrepreneurship and Innovation. 
On June 30, 2015, the City of Richmond officially launched its Open Data Portal 
(data.richmondgov.com), which created the first such open data portal in the Commonwealth of 
Virginia. At its original launch, the Open Data Portal included  over 30 machine-readable, open, 
and accessible datasets. Included in this initial launch were d atasets of public value such as 
property owner lists, GIS shape files, payments to vendors, and  police accident incidents. The City 
of Richmond is committed to making data open and available in a  machine-readable format and 
will provide additional datasets that spur the growth of our in novative, creative community of 
entrepreneurs and startups. Currently, the City’s Department of  Information Technology is 
creating an Open Data Management Team consisting of subject mat ter experts and database 
administrators from each department to prepare the release of m ore government datasets that are 
both publicly valuable and meet FOIA (Freedom of Information Ac t) requirements. Richmond’s

SMART CITY CHALLENGE GRANT APPLICATION 8 
Open Data Portal is hosted by Socrata, the industry leader in m aking government data readily 
available and discoverable onlin e. The process for uploading da tasets includes th e ability to input 
metadata which further explains the content and meaning of gove rnment information and fields. 
There are built-in tools that reduce the technical capacity req uired to use and interpret published 
datasets in the portal. There is also a built-in application pr ogram interface, or API, that allows for 
website and applications to read ily access published data and i nformation. The City is committed 
to expanding the number of datasets available on our Open Data Portal and further promote 
accessibility, transparency, and accountability of government s ervices and information. The City 
has a Code for RVA Brigade, a group of passionate citizens with  the skills, drive, and ability to 
transform data on the Open Data Portal into public applications , visualizations, and maps. Brigades 
across the country are  huge catalysts for t he consumption of pu blic data as well as proponents for 
the improvement of data quality and accuracy. Code for RVA Brig ade is leading the innovation of 
open data in Richmond that promo tes the entrepreneurial spirit within the community.  
Mrs. Smith’s ability to work is limited given complications fro m several years of fighting 
Type II Diabetes, and she spends hours on the bus every month t raveling to see a doctor 
located on the other side of the city that offers low-cost care  for managing her condition, 
which her insurance doesn’t cover. Her condition could probably  be controlled, allowing her to 
work at least part-time, if she could keep up with her regular appointments and medication. 
However, she often misses her appointments or fails to pick up her medicine when she is feeling 
too sick to take the multiple bus trips required to reach her p rovider.  
Long History of Transportation Innovation 
Richmond has a history of embr acing innovative and practical tr ansportation technology for as 
long as our nation is old. In 1790, the James River Company ope ned the first commercial canal in 
the United States. Located along a seven mile route paralleling  the river at Richmond, what became 
the James River and Kanawha Canal (a project first proposed, an d then surveyed, by George 
Washington when he was a young man), connected the navigable wa ters downstream of Richmond 
to those upstream. The first stagecoach lines to Richmond were established during the War of 
1812, and the first regular steamboat service began on the Jame s River in 1815. Significantly, 
Richmond had the first successful electrically powered street r ailway system in the U.S. Designed 
by electric power pioneer, Frank J. Sprague, the trolley system  opened its first line in January 1888  
and his design expanded into worldwide use. Richmond’s hills, l ong a transportation obstacle, 
were considered an ideal provi ng ground and the new technology soon replaced horse cars and 
accelerated Richmond’s expansion. In 1955, prior to the creatio n of the U.S. Interstate Highway 
System, the Virginia General Assembly created the Richmond–Pete rsburg Turnpike Authority as 
an independent state agency to administer a new Turnpike of the  same name. The new road was 
planned as an expressway with only 15 exits, most of which were  well away from the highly 
developed commercial areas along parallel U.S. 1-301. Upon open ing in 1958, the State Highway 
Commission designated it as part of Interstate 95, becoming a g randfathered part of the U.S. 
Interstate Highway System. Finally, as described above, project  partner GRTC is in the process of 
developing a BRT line in Richmond. The “Pulse” will run from Ro cketts Landing east of 
downtown to Henrico County to the west.   
Commitment to Diverse, Sustainable, and Healthy Mobility 
The City recognizes that there is an important nexus of opportu nity between public health, 
environmental sustainability, and transportation. The City and project partners are committed to 
 
 
SMART CITY CHALLENGE GRANT APPLICATION 9 
diverse, sustainable, and healthy mobility, as evidenced by pol icy, investments, and plans. 
Richmond has adopted policy positons that commit to promoting h ealthy, sustainable, and diverse 
mobility. Richmond’s Health in All Policies (HiAP) approach is intended to improve the health of 
all people by incorporating hea lth considerations into decision -making across sectors. HiAP brings 
together decision-makers from the City, public schools, and Cit y Health District to collaboratively 
develop policies, programs, and services that promote health fo r all City residents. In doing so, 
HiAP creates a framework to discuss how to create policies and programs that will meet 
community goals while supporting and protecting public health. HiAP ensures that all factors that 
contribute to health and well-being are considered in all gover nmental policy decisions that impact 
where people live, work, learn, and play. HiAP will ensure that  healthy mobility considerations 
are part of all Smart City initiatives. 
Additionally, the City adopted Complete Streets Policy in 2014,  a transportation policy and design 
approach that helps make communities healthier, more livable, e conomically competitive, and safe 
from. The policy requires streets to be designed and operated i n a manner to be safe, comfortable 
and convenient for all users regardless of age, ability or mode  of travel. The goal of the City’s 
Complete Streets Policy is to balance the access, mobility, and  safety of all users while creating a 
stronger and healthier community. The Complete Streets approach  was a guiding principle in the 
Richmond Strategic Multimodal Transportation Plan adopted in 20 13,8 which describes actions 
and plans that the City will take over the next 20 years to imp rove transportation.  
The James River is four miles from Kari’s house. She sees it on  the bus every time her 
mother takes her to the doctor’s office, but she’s only been th ere once, on a school field 
trip. There’s an art museum on the other side of town where adm ission is always free, 
but her mother says the bus ride would be too long to see it on  a Saturday. There are free kids’ 
yoga classes and guided hiking excursions and $1 movies at a th eater in the West End of 
Richmond, but none of these things are on the bus route, so Kar i is left out.  
The City proactively promotes sustainable 
transportation options, a position made clear in the Richmond Bicycle Master Plan, completed in 2014. The City has invested heavily in pedestrian and bicycling infrastructure in recent years, creating bike lanes, sharrow marking, and bike racks throughout the city, and has created a Pedestrian, Bicycle, and Trails Coordinator position that is involved in all transportation-related pla nning. The City has begun 
converting its fleet to CNG fueled vehicles, as GRTC has done with its busses, and is committed to reducing its vehicle-related carbon footprint. Finally, the Richmond Strategic Multimodal Tr ansportation Plan calls for exp anding Level 2 charging station 
availability, particularly at ma jor employer park ing facilities  and multimodal hubs such as Main 
Street Station.
9 The City’s promotion of diverting travel from personal vehicle s to more sustainable 
transportation, as well as promo tion of electric vehicles and f leet conversion to CNG, will have a

measurable impact on the environm ent and on long-term sustainab ility. The diversion of gasoline 
powered vehicular traffic from hi ghways and streets via individ ual personal vehicles to walking, 
biking, transit, rail, and electric vehicles will reduce the gr eenhouse gas (GHG) emission, which 
has an associated cost to society in terms of negative health i mpacts.  
Commitment to Building Wealth and Fighting Poverty  
The City is in the process of developing important transportati on infrastructure and taking 
unprecedented action to create economic opportunities and empow er citizens in our communities 
of greatest need. A number of exciting initiatives are underway  that set Richmond apart from many 
other mid-size U.S. cities that would be complemented, supporte d, and brought to fruition through 
the introduction of Smart City tr ansportation strategies. First , project partner GRTC is about to 
commence construction of the Pul se BRT line, as described above , connecting Richmond with job 
centers and growth areas downtown and in Henrico County, ensuri ng bus service reliability 
through traffic signal prioritiza tion and dedicated transit lan es. Second, the City established the 
Office of Community Wealth Building (CWB), the first municipal office of its type in the nation 
to combat poverty and create wealth. CWB seeks to address the r oot causes and on-going 
conditions of poverty in Richmond,  a significant one of which i s a lack of transportation between 
areas of concentrated poverty and areas of economic opportunity . Lastly, Richmond has been 
designated by USDOT as a Ladders of Opportunity Transportation Empowerment Pilot, one of 
seven U.S. cities to receive that designation. The technical as sistance provided by the LadderSTEP 
program, and the on-going efforts of CWB, will support efforts by public and private partners to 
improve access to areas of employment opportunities for our tra nsit-dependent residents should 
Richmond be chosen as the Smart City Challenge recipient.   
Too old for the little kids who swarm on the small playground a t the edge of the public 
housing community near Kari’s ho use and too young for the older  teenage girls who are 
practicing to be women, Kari watches a lot of TV, sits on her s toop and talks to her 
friends, and tries to stay out of the way of older boys who tau nt her for being a little too heavy. 
There is very little Kari can do about being heavy - there isn’ t anywhere to exercise, or anyone 
offering to show her how if she wanted to learn

5. ALIGNMENT WITH USDOT VISION ELEMENTS  
 We envision urban automation will bring unprecedented 
opportunities in promoting carshari ng and automated driving on 
designated lanes, among others. One of challenges in Richmond, and 
likely in many other cities, is having unbalanced job and resid ent 
locations. We will use urban automation to help address moving those workers without personal 
vehicles from their residence to work places. In addition to in creasing bikeshare and pedestrian 
access to traditional transit services, low-speed, electric aut omated shuttles will move people, 
connecting Ladders of Opportunity  and other transportation-disa dvantaged communities, college 
campuses, tourist destinations, the Greater Richmond Convention  Center, and other locations, 
by providing last mile services to other multi-modal transporta tion opportunities. These flexible-
route, flexible-schedule shuttles can serve niche markets for o n-demand or fixed route mobility. 
In addition to increasing connectivity and mobility, these vehi cles can also serve as a strategy 
for decreasing mobile emissions in the Richmond region. Long-ha ul on-demand mobility 
services (such as Uber and Lyft) may also be considered in such  a system, utilizing an innovative 
reservation system (via mobile app) to connect travelers and se rvice providers. Researchers at 
the University of Virginia’s Complete Mobility and Center for T ransportation Studies have 
developed agent-based models examining the operations of shared  automated vehicles, and plan 
to adapt this model to Richmond’s travel and network patterns. The City will work with 
researchers and with private f irms to identify opportunities fo r use. Initially, l ow-speed, electric 
automated shuttles will function as Limited Self-Driving Automa tion (Level 3) vehicles. 
Vehicle Priority and Pre-Emption CENTRACS 
 Richmond will deploy City Fleet (Police, Fire, and School Bus) and 
Transit Vehicle to Infrastructur e for emergency incident respon se and 
real-time traffic signal operati ons with adaptive Transit Vehic le 
Signal Priority and Emergency Pr eemption through centralized mo del connecting E-911 
Advanced Vehicle Location (AVL) to the Advanced Transportation Management System 
(Centracs). Our partner at UVA al ready developed and demonstrat ed the performance of transit 
signal priority under Connect ed Vehicles environment.10 
 Richmond’s Pulse (BRT) will be a “connected vehicle to infrastr ucture” system with real-time 
traffic signal phase selection a nd sequencing with Centracs int egration and real-time AVL 
technology.  BRT vehicles will have an automated docking system  to improve travel time and 
reliability. 
 Richmond will use vehicles as mobile probes to identify hazardo us winter roads for driver 
alerting and improved winter maintenance operations (e.g. deice r application, plowing) –  
Original equipment vehicle onboard sensors are used within a Co nnected Vehicle Framework to 
report slippery road conditions.  This information can then be used by drivers and road 
maintenance agencies to improve safety and diminish the environ mental costs and infrastructure 
damage resulting from salt application.

passengers who are enter or leaving the bus. 
Improved infrastructure-based vehicle traffic sensing for load-
dependent signal synchronization  
 Richmond will have access to Virginia Tech Transportation 
Institute’s (VTTI) Center for Sustainable Mobility (CSM), which  
conducts research in multimodal transportation network control,  traffic signal control, transit 
signal priority, emergency vehicle preemption, eco-transportati on system development and 
testing, connected vehicle appli cation algorithmic development and field testing, dynamic transit 
routing and scheduling systems, and automated vehicle applicati on algorithmic development and 
field testing. Advanced vehicle d etection technologies provide information on traffic presence, 
density, and flow that can im prove traffic flow through signal synchronization.  
 With sensors in connected and auto mated vehicles, and with sens ors in infrastructure (including 
loop, video, radar detectors, and mobile phone data), Richmond will monitor traffic congestion 
and improve traffic operations through techniques such as such as traffic signal synchronization. 
Research at UVA has demonstrated that gyro sensor measures can estimate road surface 
roughness. Such techniques may replace periodic scanning by sur face detection vehicles.  
Ladders of Opportunity - Transpor tation Disadvantaged Communiti es 
 Richmond bike share will be upgrad ed to offer pedal-electric as sist 
bicycles (pedelec) to connect La dders of Opportunity communitie s in 
the east end to BRT stations and the GRTC transfer center, offe ring 
improved last-mile connections to the BRT system. 
 Richmond will use low-speed, electric automated shuttles to con nect Ladders of Opportunity 
and other transportation-disadvantaged communities, college cam puses, tourist destinations, and 
the Greater Richmond Convention Center, among others, for the l ast mile.  
 Richmond will connect pedestrian countdown timer information fo r visually impaired users to 
accessible apps and leverage LiDAR 3-D mapping of obstacles to assist visually impaired users 
(smart white cane concepts). 
 Data from these existing systems will be captured and analyzed to identify opportunities for 
improvements and extensions. 
Multimodal Connections 
 Richmond will fully automate the Port of Richmond’s multimodal connections using Navis 
software technology. 
 Richmond has invested in being the Region’s primary multimodal hub at Main Street Station, 
where it will serve as the prim ary High Speed Rail station for the Richmond Region, and serve 
as the focal point for bikeshare, electric vehicle recharging, Bus Rapid Transit, as its front door 
for multimodal connections. 
 Richmond will use social media and other user-generated data to  monitor changes in usage and 
of local transportation systems. 
  
 
 
SMART CITY CHALLENGE GRANT APPLICATION 14 
Demand-Responsive Transit for Improved Level of Service and Red uction of GHG Production: 
With assistance from VTTI, Richmond can improve transit service  and diminish its environmental 
impact. With an FTA grant, Black sburg Transit and VTTI develope d an adaptive system in 
Blacksburg, Virginia, that changes bus schedule and bus size in  real time depending on passenger 
demand. This improves level of service, and decreases fuel cons umption and GHG production. 
The project has three components: passenger demand assessment, fuel consumption modeling, and 
a dispatch demand decision suppor t system (3DSS). The developer s of the system promoted user 
adaptation through surveys and focus groups.  Riders and the tr ansit system can use a smart phone 
application for real-time travel planning and system adaptation .  The mobile application tracks 
user demand, and reports bus routes, schedules and arrival time s to users. A fuel consumption 
model was developed to measure fuel savings from the more effic ient service.  The model 
incorporates engine, GPS, elevation, bus size, passenger load, and other factors.  Passenger 
demand, system status, and fuel consumption models were integra ted within the 3DSS to advise 
dispatchers on schedule, routing, and bus selection modificatio ns that would achieve the goals of 
increased performance and efficiency. 
VTTI’s Center for Sustainable M obility (CSM): Part of the PARC team that was awarded a major 
DOE project to develop the COPTER system. The system is based o n a multi-agent view of trip 
planning and execution, whi ch takes into account: 
1. The traveler’s itinerary (t he system can search for itinerar ies that are more energy 
efficient without reducing QoS), and 
2. How the traveler executes a trip (this predominantly means r eal-time driving speed and 
re-routing suggestions). 
These two strategies are realized by the multi-agent, multi-mod al trip planning component of the 
architecture and the trip execu tion controller component, respe ctively.  These modules will utilize 
a meso-abstraction of the system micro model. The planner will consider all transportation 
alternatives, spanning personal (driving, walking, biking), pub lic (subways, buses), and private 
(express buses, cabs, ride-sharing services), taking parking av ailability into account.  The planner 
will use the predicted traffic and public transit conditions as  opposed to current or merely typical 
conditions.  These predictions, provided by the Conditions Pred iction Module, will be based on 
real-time data from the respect ive data sources (Inrix, GTFS-re altime, etc.). Unlike existing 
planners, this planner will also consider multiple travelers at  the same time, clustered by their most 
likely corridors of travel, and hence enable the dynamic creati on of ride-pools, and on-the-fly 
park-and-ride and ri de-share suggestions. 
 
Open Data 
 Mobility on Demand: Richmond will integrate shared transportati on 
(bike, vehicle) with transit and parking systems through real t ime 
traveler information.  
 Richmond will use an open architecture for roadway safety and o perations data collection, robust 
analytics, data management and governance, integration and inte roperability.   
 Richmond will use crowd-sourcing with an open data infrastructu re; citizens can improve apps 
and populate fundamental data elements (FDE), as outlined in th e Model Inventory of Roadway 
Elements.  
  
 
 
SMART CITY CHALLENGE GRANT APPLICATION 15 
 Richmond will create real-time a nonymized pedestrian / bike cou nts to determine trends and 
measure use of new facilities, such as transit and bicycle rout e planning. 
 Richmond will create real-time pot hole detection by all crowd-s ourced vehicles. 
 UVA has developed multimodal freight optimization that takes 
into account economies of scale, goods, vehicle sizes, and dist ances.  
With sensor data measuring network congestion and communications, Richmond can use this system for efficient 
allocation of delivery modes, thereby easing congestion and pro moting energy efficiency and 
sustainability without new infrastructure. 
 Richmond will continue to invest in the Port of Richmond. On Fe bruary 1, 2016, a new $4.2 
million 124-ton crane was unveiled with $17 million more in por t improvements planned on the 
120 acre site. These improvements include rail improvements and  cargo-moving equipment. The 
current barge service eliminates 15,000 tractor trailer trips a nnually. Richmond is in the center 
of the supply chain with distri bution centers such as online sh opping giant Amazon. 
Richmond will continue to reach out and engage potential future  
partners that are willing to demonstrate their technology in an  open data 
platform. If selected, Richmond is prepared to announce several  
partnerships that are cu rrently in discussion. 
 Richmond will expand the number of electric vehicle charging 
stations and wireless recharge stations for all users, as well as continue 
to convert its city fleet and transit vehicles to natural gas.  Access to 
electric vehicle charging stations can impact electric vehicle adoption 
rates, use decisions, electrified mile shares, petroleum demand , and power consumption across 
times of day. Research has demonstrated that an electric-vehicl e-based transport system’s overall 
cost can be reduced by providing m ore charging infrastructure i nstead of investing in bigger 
batteries (with greater range).
11 Researchers at the UVA have examined the planning of electric 
vehicle charging infrastructure f rom a behavioral demand perspe ctive,12 and will integrate these 
approaches with a time-of-day dimension to apply to the City of  Richmond for charging 
infrastructure planning. 
 Richmond bike share will be upgraded to offer pedal-electric as sist bicycles (pedelec) to connect 
Ladders of Opportunity communities in the east end to BRT stati ons and the GRTC transfer 
center, offering improved last-mile connections to the BRT syst em.  
Richmond will continue to pursue crowdsourcing through an open data 
platform to collect key transportation-related data to improve data 
quality through gamification and other incentives.

Richmond will ensure that only t hose applications that are tech nically 
sound and are institutionally fit to be operated far into the f uture.  
Richmond will follow the ITS Systems Engineering process to dev elop 
our technical plan that will become the framework for our Smart  City.   
Richmond embraces the open data policy so vital to the adoption  of continent-wide connected and 
autonomous vehicle operations and looks forward to contributing  our progress to this effort. 
 Richmond will use crowdsourcing that leverages an open data inf rastructure and allows citizens 
to improve apps as well as populate fundamental data elements ( FDE) as outlined in the Model 
Inventory of Roadway Elements.  
 Richmond will create real-time anonymized pedestrian / bike cou nts to determine trends and use 
of new facilities such as transit and bicycle route planning. 
 Richmond will create real-time pot hole detection by all crowd-s ourced vehicles.  
The City of Richmond feels strongly about low-cost, efficient, secure 
and resilient ICT. The vision and mission of the City’s IT depa rtment 
aligns perfectly with the goals  of Vision Element #11.  It is t he vision 
of the City’s information technology department to provide secu re, reliable and convenient access 
to the technology and information needed to support the City’s diverse selection of business, 
cultural, entertainment and recreational needs. Furthermore the  mission of the Department of 
Information Technology is to consistently add value and provide  service through the innovative 
use of information technology. Ove r the years the City has won many awards (Digital Government 
Achievement Award, Governor’s Technology Award for Innovation i n Local Government, Digital 
Cities Survey Award, and Integrated Justice Information Systems  Institute Innovation Award) 
which further demonstrates their  commitment to the vision and m ission statements.   
In support of a more resilient, efficient and secure ICT a join t effort between the City’s Department 
of Public Works – Transportation Engineering Division, Departme nt of Information Technology 
and the City’s Emergency Operati ons Center came together to bui ld out a redundant fiber optic 
network that supported the City w hen they hosted the 2015 World  Road Cycling Championships. 
Through this coordinated effort several things were accomplishe d: the traffic signal system utilized 
the City’s redundant and expansive fiber optic network to adjus t in real time to accommodate 
changing traffic patterns around the races; the CCTV cameras co nnected to the traffic signals used 
high speed fiber optic communica tions to give law enforcement a nd public safety critical 
surveillance along the race courses; lastly the redundant and s ecure fiber optic network kept the 
City’s Emergency Operations Center connected to the outside wor ld (including those CCTV 
cameras) and provided additional communications capacity for th e news media that were 
broadcasting the races live and the Federal Bureau of Investiga tion and US Department of 
Homeland Security that were keeping the area safe for participa nts and visitors alike. The use of 
City traffic cameras to inform emergency responders is an excel lent example of a contribution to 
one common platform to inform city government decision-making a nd response. The City 
supported this combined effort to provide low-cost, efficient, secure and resilient ICT. During the 
design phase of the City’s fiber optic network, redundancy and security were critical requirements.  
Both of these were implemented  to ensure that physical redundan cy was maintained in the event 
of major cuts in physical communication cabling. By installing their own network the City of 
Richmond has provided for a lower -cost alternative to expensive  private leased telecommunication 
providers. The City of Richmond with the help of a Smart City C hallenge grant plans to connect 
  
 
 
SMART CITY CHALLENGE GRANT APPLICATION 17 
additional government and educa tional facilities across the Cit y to further enable users to access, 
store, transmit, and manipulate information. Furthermore the Ci ty’s redundant, re silient, low-cost 
ICT will provide the stable backbone to successfully implement all other Vision Elements of the 
Smart City Challenge.    
Parking and Environment 
 Richmond will reduce off-street  parking requirements through 
advanced transit oriented land policies, zoning, and technology , including 
promoting car-sharing opportunities.  
 Richmond will actively manage public parking assets – both off- street and on-street—to better 
utilize existing parking assets and support the conversion of u nneeded spots to other uses like 
green infrastructure.  
 Data from these existing systems will be captured and analyzed to identify opportunities for 
improvements and extensions. 
Multimodal Connections 
 Richmond will fully automate the Port of Richmond’s multimodal connections using Navis 
software technology. 
 Richmond has invested in being the Region’s primary multimodal hub at Main Street Station, 
where it will serve as the primary High Speed Rail station for the Richmond Region, and serve 
as the focal point for bikeshare, electric vehicle recharging, Bus Rapid Transit, as its front door 
for multimodal connections. 
Social Media Monitoring of Transportation Systems for Operation s and Planning 
The data transportation system u sers generate through social me dia and other communications is 
now sufficient to supplement or replace the data transportation  system operators actively collect.   
Public “geosocial” media, such as Twitter, can be used to monit or changes in the use of local 
transportation systems at specific locations and times. Content  analysis can provide information 
about travel by a wide range of modes, and because social media  are updated continuously, 
changes in behavior and experiences can be monitored over short  time frames compared to 
traditional survey methods. Leveraging location based surveying  of users and riders of our 
transportation system will genera te new information and public perceptions about the current 
status and needs of our transportation system that can create m eaningful insights for planning and 
next steps. Textizen is a tool that has a wide-variety of uses that can support creating new data in 
a social manner based upon the inputs from riders waiting at bu s stops, using bike share, or walking 
through neighborhoods. Richmond will monitor and analyze a rang e of publicly available social 
media inputs to identify short-term system status and longer-te rm changes in usage and public 
acceptance of the multimodal transportation system instituted a s a part of the Smart City program.

High-quality public transportati on provides greater access and freedom for families. 
Once transportation innovations h ave been implemented in Richmo nd, the Smiths make 
this positive choice. Mr. Smith finds a job at a higher hourly wage and arrives there every 
day in thirty minutes via the Pulse BRT, using a “next bus” app  to know exactly when he needs to 
leave home, maximizing the time he can spend with his family. M rs. Smith uses a bike share 
program to ride a pedelec bicycle to the 17th Street Farmers’ M arket every week and spends an 
hour engaged in free taste testing and cooking demonstrations a nd shopping for local produce 
using her EBT card, and on warm Saturdays she and Kari take ped elec bikes down to the river to 
hike and swim. Mrs. Smith uses a community health shuttle for h er regular medical appointments 
and pharmacy visits. On Sundays, Kari and two other girls from her neighborhood take the Pulse 
BRT to Project Yoga where they are enrolled in a free yoga clas s – the Smiths learned about the 
class via a smartphone app which links community events and fam ily programming with GRTC 
bus routes, inviting them to connect with people and places cit ywide that had been beyond their 
reach before better transportation options emerged. Kari’s teac her is inspired by the passion of 
Kari and her friends and is plann ing to offer a free yoga class  in the public housing community in 
Kari’s neighborhood. Transportation is no longer a limiting fac tor or a source of stress for the 
Smiths, they are freer to make choices allowing them to pursue the quality of life they desire. 
6. TECHNICAL, POLICY, AND INSTITUTIONAL RISKS 
Technical Risks 
The technical risks associated  with this proposal are also a st rength of the proposal. The 
technology deployment environment can be a challenge that will test equipment durability and 
resiliency. If the proposed tec hnologies can prove their streng th, identify weaknesses, and 
incorporate lessons learned in areas with high concentrations o f residents near the poverty level, 
then the technology should be easie r to maintain in any city na tionwide. 
While the City does have basic ITS knowledge, skills, and abili ties, it has strong support from 
on-call transportation engineering consulta nts and strong partn erships with VTTI, Virginia 
Department of Transportation’ s Research Council (VTRC), and UVA . With data captured, 
archived, and disseminated by such systems, researchers can ide ntify strengths and weaknesses, 
and find opportunities for improvements. 
Policy Risks 
Virginia is open for business regarding automated and connected  corridors and so is the City. 
Through Governor Mcauliffe’s proclamation and VTTI’s management  p r o c e s s ,  t h e  C i t y  c a n  
leverage an existing process to  expedite approvals. Currently, the General Assembly has taken no 
action regarding laws restricti ng automated or connected vehicl es. During the performance period, 
Dr. Noah Goodall, with VDOT’s VTRC, will continue his research on the legality of automated 
vehicles; their certification and licensing; insurance regulati ons; traffic impacts; litigation and 
liability; safety; and consistency with other states.  
Institutional Risks 
The City elects a new mayor in November 2016. The timing of the  challenge allows candidates to 
voice their support for the City’s applicati on and further citi zen engagement this spring. The City 
is proactive regarding procuremen t and has several on-call cons ultants that have worked with 
USDOT ready to move forward with Year 1 projects for early succ esses. The City also plans to 
leverage existing funding relationships between the USDOT and w ith VDOT and VTTI to launch 
the project with trusted partn ers. The City will utilize UVA-CT S, which has lessons learned from 
  
 
 
SMART CITY CHALLENGE GRANT APPLICATION 19 
monitoring new in t echnology in transportation disadvantaged po pulations.  The City also has 
many partners to leverage roles, scheduling, and expertise. By working with the TIGER grant to 
construct the Broad Street BRT on a tight timeline through a de sign-build process, many of the 
local partners have firsthand knowledge of each other’s capabil ities and are willing to work 
together to achieve a c ommon transportation vision.

8. EXISTING TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM FEATURES 
Street and Roads: Richmond’s mix of nineteenth-cen tury street grids, urban arteri als, and 
interstate highways make it typical of mid-sized cities nationw ide. Richmond is a dynamic 
domestic and international transportation gateway adjacent to I -95 and I-64, with access to inland 
markets along I-85, I-81, and I-70. Downtown Richmond has a den se population of signal-
controlled intersections. Of its 475 intersections, 180 are gri dded, signal-controlled, closed-loop 
intersections in the city’s central business district. With Adv anced Traffic Management System 
(ATMS), Richmond connects currently 300 of its 475 intersection  sand within three years, 100 
percent of the signal-controlled  intersections will be connecte d to the centralized system. The 
ATMS is connected by fiber optic cable to the E-911 center. By 2017, the ATMS will be connected 
by fiber to the Greater Richmond Transit Company’s Transit Oper ations Center and the Virginia 
Department of Transportation’s Re gional Traffic Operations Cent er. The City now has 30 signal-
controlled intersections with ada ptive traffic signal technolog y, with plans to expand on federal 
and state routes. The number of a rterial and lane miles are as follow:  
 Arterial Miles: The city’s suburban arterials range from four t o six lanes, demonstrating open-
loop signal system progression. The City maintains approximatel y 1,860 moving lane miles 
within its geographic boundaries , 545 mile of which are arteria l.  
 Freeway Miles: The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT)  maintains the roadways at 
the City border as well as the 49.6 miles of interstate freeway  (I-64 and I-95).  
Transit Services   
The Greater Richmond Transit Company Transit System (GRTC) is t he primary public 
transportation provider for the Richmond region, providing serv ice to Richmond and a very small 
portion of the adjacent counties of Henrico and Chesterfield. I n 2008, GRTC received recognition 
from the American Public Transportation Association as the Best  Transit System in North America 
for 2008.13 GRTC is a non-profit public ser vice corporation, owned equally  by the City of

SMART CITY CHALLENGE GRANT APPLICATION 23 
Richmond and Chesterfield Count y and governed by a Board of Dir ectors.  
GRTC currently has an active fleet of 268 busses, vans, and sup port vehicles which, as they are 
retired, are replaced with vehicles fueled by compressed nature l gas (CNG). GRTC currently 
operates 156 transit vehicles for  its fixed route services, inc luding busses and cutaway vans, of 
which 42 are fueled by CNG. All GRTC busses are equipped with f ront-mounted bicycle racks. In 
addition to the fixed route system, GRTC oversees RideFinders, the region’s transportation 
demand management agency, supports the Capital Region Taxicab A dvisory Board (CRTAB), 
contracts with outside  agencies to provide Americans with Disab ilities Act (ADA) services for the 
region’s elderly and disabled population, and oversees C-VAN, a  welfare-to-work transportation 
service provided in cooperation w ith local social service agenc ies. 
GRTC’s bus route structure can la rgely be classified as a hub-a nd-spoke system, where service 
converges on a central downtown area and then fans out into the  surrounding neighborhoods. 
Additionally, GRTC operates 10 e xpress routes to Henrico and Ch esterfield counties. These 
express routes provide direct service from the surrounding resi dential areas in the outlying counties 
to downtown Richmond with few stops in between. 
All buses operated by GRTC are equipped with wheelchair lifts, and GRTC is in the process of 
increasing the number of low-floor buses in its fleet. In combi nation with drivers specifically 
trained to help disabled and senior riders, the GRTC system is accessible for mobility impaired 
customers. For riders who are unable to use fixed-route service , GRTC offers paratransit service 
through the CARE program. CARE p rovides curb-to-curb service fo r eligible riders. Eligibility for 
the program is dictated by the A mericans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

Port Facilities 
The Port of Richmond is Central Virginia’s domestic and interna tional multimodal freight and 
inland distribution gateway on th e James River. It serves water borne, rail and truck shippers 
throughout the Mid-Atlantic States with major logistics and dis tribution centers for military and 
commercial freight. The Port is an excellent distribution and t ransshipment location, with strong 
local export/import support; 50% of the nation’s consumers and manufacturing establishments are 
located within 750 miles. More th an 100 motor freight companies  an d  b ro k ers  se rv e th e ar ea ,  
including specialists  in heavy hauling, ove r-dimensional loads,  and liquid and dry bulk. The City 
owns the Port, curren tly leasing it to the Virginia Port Author ity. The Port is privately operated by 
PCI of Virginia, LLC, which provi des stevedoring services on a full range of supply chain 
operations, including export packaging and transfer, and wareho use and inland distribution

services. The Port offers three,  weekly, roundtrip container-on -barge sailings between the Port of 
Virginia marine terminals at Hampton Roads and the Port of Rich mond, a 100-mile journey along 
the James River, via the 64 Express. This barge traffic removes  container traffic from local roads 
and highways. 
Like other world ports, Richmond uses the Navis N-4 cargo handl ing information system. Navis 
tracks cargo containers from or to vessels as they move in and out of a terminal through ship, 
barge, rail, or truck, reporting “in time” information on conta iner location a nd destination. 
Terminal operators, stevedores, ship and cargo owners, transpor tation companies, and U.S. 
Customs can access the system through codes, yielding a seamles s information system. The Navis 
N-4 cargo handling information system makes Richmond a model po rt city. 
Rail Facilities 
The City of Richmond has a long history of working in a collabo rative manner with the Class 1 
Railroads, with both the Norfolk Southern and CSX railroads loc ated in the heart of the City. 
Richmond has the only triple crossing in the world where CSX an d Norfolk Southern railroads 
converge at a single point. Ric hmond’s freight rail infrastruct ure is a critical connection for 
east/west and north/south rail corridors of the Mid-Atlantic Re gion. These freight railroads service 
the Port of Virginia, includi ng the inland Richmond Port, as we ll as points north of the District of 
Colombia and Maryland. The City of Richmond will continue to fo ster the relationship with the 
railroad industry, as we have a strong belief that shipping fre ight by rail is the most efficient and 
beneficial mode for ha uling long distances.   
Air Facilities 
The Richmond International Airport (RIC) is owned and operated by the Capital Region Airport 
Commission, governed by 14 Commissi oners appointed by four Rich mond-area jurisdictions – the 
City, along with the counties of Chesterfield, Hanover, and Hen rico. RIC has about 105,000 
landings/take-offs and accommodates more than three million vis itors annually and is a designated 
alternative landing site for Was hington D.C. air traffic, and i s utilized by Air F orce One and Two 
for crew proficiency training and presidents Bush and Obama hav e visited Richmond onboard Air 
Force One a combined ten times since 2000. 
RIC is one of the busiest air cargo facilities in the nation, a veraging more than 100 million pounds 
of cargo annually. Because of its  central location on the Easte rn Seaboard, cargo transit via RIC 
makes sense as goods shipped from RIC area can reach 50% of the  U.S. population within 24 
hours. RIC has been designated a Foreign-Trade Zone (FTZ) #207,  where foreign and domestic 
merchandise is considered to be in international commerce (not in U.S. Commerce territory), 
meaning that foreign merchandise may be admitted into the forei gn-trade zone without payment 
of Customs duties or government excise taxes. The Capital Regio n Airport Commission has 
applied to the Foreign-Trade Zone s Board for reorganization of Foreign-Trade Zone #207 under 
alternate site framework (ASF) to permit significantly greater flexibility in the designation of new 
“subzones” or “usage-driven” FTZ sites.15

Smart Grid Infrastructure:   
Dominion Virginia Power is the largest electric utility in the state. Dominion’s Powering Virginia 
Plan began in 2008. The plan provides a jump-start toward meeti ng the 10% conservation goal 
enacted by the Virginia General Assembly and the governor. This  enables the state to be within 
one-third of its goal within a five year period. The smart grid  would allow energy to be delivered 
more efficiently, resulting in s ignificant savings, by allowing  precise control over its flow. 
According to an IEE smart meter survey completed in May 2012, D ominion has installed over 
100,000 smart meters across Virginia in an effort to demonstrat e the technology and customer 
benefits.  The utility industry i s in the midst of grid moderni zation efforts to ensure a more secure, 
cost effective, environmentally safe power grid. The next gener ation of metering and data 
exchange technology or AMI technologies are the basis and most viable elements of the smart 
grid.  Many Virginians may decide to replace their traditional automobile with an electric vehicle. 
The change will require a reliable, low-cost way to recharge th e vehicle at convenient locations at 
anytime, day and night. Millions of owners will plug in or use wireless technology to charge their 
electric vehicles. Richmond will take advantage of smart grid t echnologies and be ready to handle 
the new demand, seamlessly. A smarter grid can safeguard Richmo nd’s position at the forefront 
of the world’s transition toward a clean energy future. Vehicle s-to-grid technology can also be 
used with BEVs and PHEV plug-in s and provide extra grid capacit y. 
9. DATA 
Existing Data Collection 
The City collects data on traffic control devices, pavement con ditions, MIRE roadway inventory 
elements, crash data, driver and vehicle registration data, hea lth outcomes data, and real time 
information such as work in street permits, emergency vehicle a nd transit vehicle locations, etc. 
The City also collects data on the Request for Service from the  citizens and uses it to deploy its 
resources to serve residents. 
Proposed Data Collection 
We are entering a new era of expectations and the goal for all agencies should be to use up-to-date 
information for making better decisions. It is acknowledged tha t 80% of the data has a location 
context and where you are, where you want to go, what is the re al time weather, traffic, what is 
the demographics etc. cease to be separate streams of data.  Mo bile apps are not only increasing 
the consumption of the data but also steering how and what need s to be collected and used. 
Integrating transportation data with other functional data give s a Common Operational Picture 
which is key and critical to se rvice providers and responders. Also platform barriers have to 
addressed and provided for in t he dissemination of information.  Quality of life index is a derivative   
 
 
SMART CITY CHALLENGE GRANT APPLICATION 26 
of all factors such as public saf ety, transit, schools, infrast ructure, etc., and therefore all data has 
great significance in integration. Geographic Information Syste ms serve as a great integration tool 
using the location as the key factor. Open architecture allows for programming interfaces to 
communicate with other systems fo r porting the data across diff erent information streams.  
Proposed Data Analysis 
If funding were available, the City would like to collect such transportation data on shorter 
intervals of three to five years, which would also be in line w ith FHWA best practices for MIRE 
and FDE as well as asset condition assessments for maintenance purposes. We are entering a new 
era of expectations and the goal for all agencies should be to use up-to-date information for making 
better decisions. It is acknowledged that 80% of the data has a  location context and where you are, 
where you want to go, what is the real time weather, traffic, w hat is the demographics etc. cease 
to be separate streams of data.  Mobile apps are not only incre asing the consumption of the data 
but also steering how and what needs to be collected and used. Integrating transportation data with 
other functional data gives a Com mon Operational Picture which is key and critical to service 
providers and responders. Also platform barriers have to addres sed and provided for in the 
dissemination of information. Quality of life index is a deriva tive of all factors such as public 
safety, transit, schools, infrastructure etc. and therefore all  data has great significance in 
integration. Geographic Information Systems serve as a great in tegration tool using the location as 
the key factor.  Open architectur e of systems allows for progra mming interfaces to communicate 
with other systems for porting th e data across different stream s of information 
Proposed Data Interoperability 
It is important that an open data architecture be used to seaml essly connect multiple data streams 
for analysis. The City is also committed to pursuing solutions that are transferrable to other cities 
across the country.  The Open Data Portal is focused on making City data publicly va luable and 
available. Reducing the technical  needs to access and use publi cly defined data i s an instrumental 
component to increasing its inter operability. Utilizing open da ta standards as well as best practices 
from leading cities in the United States is a crucial element t o establish connectivity of our open 
datasets with other internal sour ces of information as well as external datasets. A  core function of 
the Open Data Management Team, which will drive and support the  sustainability of the Open 
Data Portal for all City departments and agencies, will be to a ssure that all available and relevant 
data is made available and that it is accurate, up-to-date, and  accountable. Interoperability is 
foundational, as the value of ope n datasets is ex ponentially in creased when disparate datasets are 
able to be connected, compared, and analyzed to improve the ove rall quality of the dataset, its 
public use and value, as well as its ease of use in websites an d mobile applications.  
Existing Data Policies and Sources 
VTTI will lead the data governance and data management portion for all transportation data 
collected and analyzed in the C ity’s demonstration projects. 
VTTI Data Services Center 
The Data Services Group handles uploading of collected data, th e management and large-scale 
storage of data, data tracking, da ta quality control and assura nce, database building, optimization, 
and maintenance. The Data Serv ices back end is housed in two lo cations and features:  
 40+ high-performance servers 
 More than 100 TB of redundant high-speed storage with a full pe tabyte available for video 
 A large-capacity backup system that includes a tape library cap able of handling 14.4 gigabytes   
 
 
SMART CITY CHALLENGE GRANT APPLICATION 27 
of data per minute 
 High-speed 10-gigabit Ethe rnet for all connections 
VTTI pioneered the implementation of this technology to every p ortal. VTTI plans to dedicate a 
teraflop of computing power toward facial recognition to allow identification of individual drivers 
within a given study and link them with the real-time data coll ected during their driving activities, 
ultimately helping to refine analyses. 
Big Data: VTTI has considerable facility with various “big data ” systems, with the capability to 
store several petabytes of stru ctured and unstructured data, in tegrated into VTTI'’s High 
Performance Computing environmen t. This provides a base infrast ructure for subsequent data 
mining of various systems, to be leveraged for research and ope rational opportunities. An element 
of ""big data"" systems is the wid e variety of data sources which  can then be correlated to find 
otherwise unknown relationships. It is proposed that all “smart ” subsystems provide operational 
data feeds and ingested into this environment, where subsequent  analysis and research can be 
performed.  These data will be available to researchers beyond Richmond. 
10. APPROACH TO ITS STANDARDS, ARC HITECTURES, AND CERTIFICATION  
Plan the project – then build the plan: To ensure long lasting,  beneficial step-changes for 
transportation using the converg ence of technologies in as orga nized and effective way as possible, 
we ensure that only applications that are technically sound and  institutionally fit to be operated far 
into the future. Richmond will follow the ITS Systems Engineeri ng process to develop a technical 
plan that will become the framework for our Smart City. The cur rent regional ITS architecture was 
developed using the US National ITS Architecture. The project t eam will update the architecture 
and secure the ability for connected and autonomous vehicles to  travel city roadways by using the 
Connected Vehicle Reference Implementation Architecture and SET - I T  t o o l s  t o  p e r f o r m  t h e  
update. The project team is well-versed in how to create the Ri chmond CVRIA to help us 
efficiently reach our Smart City goals.  Richmond embraces the open data policy so vital to the adoption  of continent-wide connected and 
autonomous vehicle operations and looks forward to contributing  our progress to this effort. The 
project team will seek out necessary information from the USDOT ’s Research Data Exchange 
(RDE) & Open Source Application Development Portal (OSADP) as t he Smart City plan for 
Richmond’s future is developed.  
Standards are ever-changing and improving. As part of the Smart  City Challenge, Richmond is 
fully prepared to move toward the cutting edge of standards. We  will seek out technologies and 
applications that utilize the latest approved iteration of stan dards where available (such as an ATC 
V6.24 standard versus the 2006-approved ATC V5.2b) and will als o rely on our top-notch 
technical team to support us when moving into the unchartered n ot-yet-a-standard areas. Our team 
includes members of the interna tional standards harmonization t eam, ISO/TC204, and individuals 
responsible for standardization testing and certifications to h elp us create our integrated and 
integral Smart City applications.  
Richmond has been keeping up to date with the various USDOT and  international ITS and 
connected vehicle advancements, application suites, pilots, and  tests (such as Dynamic Mobile 
Applications, Safety Pilot, current CV Pilots, and other intern ational pilots) and will assess these 
state-of-the-practi ce tools for suitability in achieving our go als.  
UVA has a long history of evalua ting the effectiveness of new a pproaches to technology   
 
 
SMART CITY CHALLENGE GRANT APPLICATION 28 
utilization. Proposed to join UVA as a future partner, the VCU engineering school integrates the 
City’s health goals and is conve niently located in the midst of  the Richmond. VCU has an 
additional impetus for being a pr oject partner as the VCU stude nts will benefit from the Richmond 
Smart City applications. They represent one of Richmond’s body of connected and involved 
citizens! VCU’s engineering schoo l includes undergraduate and g raduate programs in electrical 
and computer, biomedical, mechanical and nuclear, chemical and life science, and computer 
science engineering fields. The joint UVA/VCU/VT educational an d research support team affords 
the City a dynamic team of partners who are well qualified to s upport the documentation and 
evaluation should the City be select ed as the Smart City Challe nge recipient.

within departments and measure effectiveness through a focus on  service level performance and 
industry standards.  Additionall y, the budget has been develope d to target and address service level 
performance. This approach has made the use of benchmarking and  gathering metrics central to 
being a performance based organization. In July of 2015, the Ci ty received the Certificate of 
Distinction from ICMA Insights for the work of the City’s perfo rmance management efforts on 
comparative analysis, and transparency. 
13. LEVERAGE O PPORTUNITIES 
The opportunities to provide leverage funding are from three pr imary sources: the City Capital 
Improvement Plan (Capital Budget), value of in-kind donations c omposed primarily of City and 
project partners’ staff time and facility use, and private fund ing associated with transportation, 
energy, technology, and other indust ries interested in particip ating in proof of concept or 
demonstration projects and willing to bring their own resources  to fund Smart City projects.  
Cost Share: The adopted/approved City Capital Budget includes $ 30.3 million in Transportation 
projects during City fiscal years (FYs) 2016-2018, which is use d here as a rough proxy for the 
Smart City Challenge implementation period. Transportation-rela ted projects included in FY 
2016-2018 Capital Budget years include street and sidewalk impr ovements, route relocations, 
roundabouts, traffic calming, street  lighting, and traffic cont rol installations. In addition to 
transportation projects, the sam e FYs include planned economic and community development 
projects with significant transportation-related elements inclu ding funding for GRTC’s Pulse 
BRT, Main Street Station multi-modal facility, commercial corri dor improvements, Port/riverfront 
access, corridor/gateway blight abatement, and public housing t ransformation projects totaling 
$19.4 million. Finally, a number of Capital Budget funded Publi c Safety projects planned for the 
same period have significant transportation-related elements in cluding 800 MHz radio system 
expansion and fire station renovations totaling $34.3 million. Funding for many of these projects 
represent potential leverage opportunities for Smart City Chall enge demonstrations. Should the 
City be selected as a Smart City Finalist, detailed leverage nu mbers will be included in the 
proposed budget.  
In-kind donations: The City staff that is not assigned to a pro ject will provide in-kind management 
services and coordinate directl y with the appropriate Federal a nd state DOT contacts, as will staff 
from Smart City  Challenge partner organizations, most notably staff from VTTI, UVA, and the 
Commonwealth of Virginia. The market rent value of City, State,  and other partners’ facilities and 
other resourced proposed to be used will also be included in th e calculus. Should the City be 
selected as a Smart City Finalis t, detailed in-kin d values will  be included in the proposed budget. 
Partnering: If selected as a finalist, there are multiple oppor tunities that will be pursued with private 
firms that have had discussions  with City staff regarding parti cipating in Smart City 
Demonstrations. Only those organizations willing to provide fin ancial resources for proof of 
concept or demonstration project purposes and do not pose a pot ential procurement issue will be 
able to be included in the quantification of private funding. H owever, the City reserves the right 
to announce those partnerships at the right time. Should the Ci ty be selected as a Smart City 
Finalist, detailed private leverag e numbers will be included in  the proposed budget.

Introduction from the Honorable Kasim Reed, Mayor o f Atlanta 
 
We are pleased to submit our proposal to the U.S. D epartment of Transportation to win the 
“Beyond Traffic: The Smart City Challenge” award.  
We have worked diligently to create a new vision fo r Atlanta to become the transportation city 
of the future. The Challenge has mobilized us to wo rk together—internally within city 
government and with civic, private sector, nonprofi t and university organizations across our 
region.  
Atlanta is a community of collaborators. In fact, w e are renowned as a city of partners—one 
that is well positioned to bring our entire innovat ion ecosystem together to be a global leader 
in transportation technologies.  In addition, you w ill see throughout our proposal the strategies 
to build from our existing infrastructure assets an d to develop a more connected urban mobility 
framework. We are mindful of the opportunity to res hape our future, to build a safer, more 
resilient, sustainable city.  
As we move along the journey of innovation, we will  break out a new map—not the old map 
that shows where we have been, but the new one that  shows where we are going. We are 
headed in a new direction that increases economic o pportunity and social mobility; creating a 
transportation network that reconnects neighborhood s, inspires new forms of civic 
engagement, embraces “smart” technology and fosters  investment decisions and dollars that 
are aligned to create a better quality of life for all who live, work and play in Atlanta.  
 
With sincere appreciation, 
 
 
 
 
Kasim Reed 
Mayor of Atlanta

 1 – Vision  
Atlanta’s Challenge 
Atlanta’s beginnings, dating back to 1836, are root ed in transportation. When Georgia first 
designated the “Terminus” for a rail line from the South to the Midwest, our city’s destiny was 
forged to grow as a rail hub, a distribution center , and today, a vibrant communications, 
technology and transportation mecca.  
We believe that Atlanta truly deserves to win this Challenge. In fact, we know of no other city 
that can leverage its history of transportation cha llenges and turn its problems into competitive 
advantages that build a smarter, more inclusive, mo re vital community. 
Our challenges run the gamut…  
• Divisive highway systems that have segregated our c ity and contributed to the forcing of 
growth out to the suburbs, away from ready public t ransportation options.  
• Neighborhood clusters with high unemployment rates and residents who lack access to 
transportation and workforce services. 
• A historical lack of an overall regional ability to  connect many underserved communities to 
major transportation systems, jobs, education, heal thcare and affordable housing. 
• Continuous outward development has created an autom obile commuter culture, resulting 
in daily roadway congestion that negatively impacts  residents, commuters, commerce and 
our environment. 
• The need for improved public transit and multi-moda l options that span the city and foster 
new density and development to spur economic growth  in town. 
All coming together to contribute to our core chall enge— the need for social inclusion and 
mobility, the need to create economic opportunity f or all of our citizens, the need to hear all 
of the voices in our community and ensure better ac cess to jobs, education, healthcare, 
housing and other critical city services . We acknowledge the current state of affairs:  
• A study by the Brookings institution found that a c hild born at the 25th percentile of income 
in Atlanta saw an 8% decrease in earnings relative to the national average by age 26.  
• In a 2012 study conducted by The American Business Journal, the Gini Index, a measure of 
income equality, ranked Atlanta 78th out of 102 met ro areas 
• According to analysis completed in 2012 by the Amer ican Association of State Highway and 
Transportation Officials, as of FY2010, Georgia ran ked 49th out of 50 states in per capita 
state transit funding levels ($0.22/person). 
These challenges have led us to explore a fresh, bo ld approach. We see the mandate to create a 
safer, more mobile, more resilient city. As you wil l see throughout this proposal, we plan to 
leverage our community, our partners, and our techn ology to turn our challenges into 
solutions.

 Atlanta’s Vision 
We embrace a bold commitment to social mobility and  economic opportunity for all Atlantans. 
We are “Reimagining Atlanta” to strengthen our lega cy transportation networks, to create new, 
innovative modes of transport and urban mobility an d to leverage advanced technologies 
across our region. 
 
Our vision is crafted by our collaborations. It is designed to ensure the flow of commerce and to 
better connect people, providing access to jobs, ed ucation and housing to improve the quality 
of their lives. Our vision is also shaped by our ch allenges. In fact, we have reimagined a future 
that sets Atlanta apart and shows the spirit of our  community and the strength of our 
commitment to be a model for our nation as the “tra nsportation city of the future.”  
 
Most importantly, our vision is rooted in the funda mentals of the dream of Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr., a legendary hero from the city of Atlanta , where we close the social, economic, and 
digital divides.  
 
We imagine Atlanta as… 
 
/checkbld a beacon of urban mobility , connecting people with the transportation options  they need  
 
/checkbld a socially inclusive city , enabling low-income communities to use new modes of 
transportation to achieve upward economic mobility 
 
 
/checkbld a smarter city , where data and technology are leveraged to reduce  the number of 
vehicles on the road, smooth the peak commute perio ds, and increase the use of public, 
low-carbon emission alternatives 
 
/checkbld a more innovative city , engaging private sector, civic and university lea ders to implement 
urban automation, connected vehicles, sensors and a nalytics 
 
/checkbld a city with smooth flowing traffic for commuters in and out of the city, for riders of  our 
public transit systems, and for everyone who uses o ur roads 
/checkbld an urban logistics leader that has world class move ment  of goods and freight , with 
efficient, sustainable and secure systems connectin g the region  
/checkbld a safer city, welcoming and connecting all modes of  transportation  in the sharing 
economy—for cars, bicycles and pedestrians 
 
/checkbld an engaged and connected city , embracing our culture, our diversity and skill as  
collaborator and partners—a model for the world  
We believe that Atlanta is optimally positioned to shine a light on transportation 
transformation—to be the “North Star,” leading our entire community and the nation to a 
better, more sustainable environment. 
While complex, accomplishing this vision is realist ic and attainable. To get us there, we have 
developed a framework that leads from the vision st atement to a set of executable projects. 
This framework consists of Vision – Objectives – Solution – Projects . As you will see in this 
response, our solution and projects will leverage i nnovative practices, technology, public-
private partnerships, Atlanta’s renowned higher edu cational institutions, and policy changes to  Atlanta Reimagined 
 
4 
 create seamless, pleasant, productive transportatio n experiences that enable citizens to 
navigate across the city and affords them pathways to prosperity.   
Atlanta’s Objectives 
To guide the vision of Atlanta Reimagined , we have translated the vision into five distinct 
objectives . These objectives ensure that the key elements of o ur vision transform into specific 
plans and actions. They will also drive our solutio n and numerous ongoing and planned 
complementary projects that will bring Atlanta Reimagined  to life. 
Atlanta’s objectives are as follows: 
1. Expand mobility options and enable economic opportu nities for the underserved 
2. Make travel – both public and private – faster, eas ier and safer for all citizens across all 
modes of transportation 
3. Improve commerce and attract employers, building ne w collaborations to grow our 
economic strength as a city 
4. Move and deploy efficiently the goods needed by cit izens and businesses 
5. Reduce the environmental impacts of transportation and logistics 
Atlanta’s Proposed Solution 
Atlanta’s proposed solution to achieve our objectiv es and vision contains 3 key components:  
1. A network of Connected Transportation Centers  (CTCs) , used for both people and freight, 
that will link into and build upon our existing pub lic transportation system. These CTCs 
include both new access nodes that link into Atlant a’s existing network and the 
augmentation of key hubs within the existing system .  
2. A Smart City Command Center (SCCC ), powered by big data and analytics, that will mon itor 
and analyze data from sources across the city, incl uding the CTC network, to maximize the 
efficiency of the network. The SCCC will be a new a ddition to our information technology 
capability, enabled through a valuable collaboratio n with Georgia Tech 
3. An improved Technology Infrastructure Backbone  to support our network and analytics 
capabilities. This backbone will strengthen physica l technology infrastructure, including 
many planned and in-progress projects across the ci ty. It will also be a test bed for the 
implementation of key transportation and logistics technology standards. 
Together, these components will deliver a solution that incorporates all twelve of the U.S. 
DOT’s Smart City Vision Elements to reach our overa ll vision: To increase social mobility and 
economic opportunity for the citizens of Atlanta, a nd ultimately, the entire Atlanta region. 
One important note  - As you will see in the ensuing sections of this document, our proposed 
solution design minimizes the need for new public t ransportation built infrastructure, including 
bridges, roads and rail. Instead, it focuses on imp roving the use of existing infrastructure to 
achieve the goals of this proposal. Because of this , we believe this program is feasibly scalable 
to a regional, and even national, level.  Atlanta Reimagined 
 
5 
 Solution Component 1 – The CTC Network 
The Connected Transportation Center network is the core of Atlanta’s overall solution. It will 
consist of both new locations and the augmentation of existing transportation points. The CTC 
network provides both physical and virtual elements . It enables multi-modal transit for 
pedestrians, cars, bikes and freight. It leverages physical infrastructure and builds out 
capabilities for new transportation modes, while ov erlaying a myriad of technical applications 
that enable safer, faster and more efficient routin g, navigation and access.  
Connected Transportation Center nodes will be strat egically located in specific areas of the city 
based on their core access goals (e.g. – access for  disadvantaged populations, access to jobs 
and other resources, commuter access, freight and l ogistics access). Each CTC will serve as a 
connecting point both into and out of Atlanta’s tra nsportation network, while also delivering 
services at the physical location. In many cases, t hese centers will host community activities 
and be a beacon of activity: smart lockers, educati on, training, new technology, etc. They will 
also be a hub for advanced automotive technologies:  autonomous vehicles, electric vehicle 
fleets (shuttles), connected vehicles and infrastru cture, sensor network, etc.  
For CTCs specifically designed to provide access to  disadvantaged communities, community 
zones will be identified based on the following cri teria: 
• Locations outside of Atlanta’s existing inner urban  core that contain a substantial 
population of residents but are currently underserv ed by mass transit. 
• Populations with critical unmet needs, such as acce ss to jobs, food, and medical care. 
• Locations that have existing or planned significant  development efforts that can be 
leveraged to drive more housing for lower income fa milies, create new landmarks to 
increase traffic into areas, or promote business in gress into the area. Examples of such 
locations include the Turner Field neighborhoods, G oogle Fiber neighborhoods, anchor 
public schools, The Beltline’s Southwest Spur Trail  and the Fulton Industrial business 
corridor.  
In addition to the new CTC nodes, key connection po ints within Atlanta’s existing public 
transportation system will be augmented by CTC tech nology. These points include Hartsfield-
Jackson Atlanta International Airport and its conne cted Aerotropolis business development, 
MARTA’s Five Points hub station, MARTA’s Lenox Squa re station and the Atlanta Beltline. 
While new CTC nodes will be located outside of exis ting transportation hotspots, these CTCs 
will connect both with each other and with existing  transportation hubs identified above. There 
are multiple benefits to this approach: 
• The CTC network builds on Atlanta’s existing transp ortation infrastructure, leveraging past 
investments and current initiatives.  
• The CTC network creates more access points into Atl anta’s existing transportation network, 
bringing transit to a much larger segment of the po pulation and business community. 
• The CTC network creates opportunities for more effi cient connections between any points 
in the City, making it faster and easier for citize ns to access jobs, groceries, healthcare and 
other core services and amenities, and for goods to  reach households and businesses.  Atlanta Reimagined

 • CTCs can serve as development anchor points around which communities can be revitalized 
through increases in inbound and outbound traffic, as well as through associated 
development policies and projects that ensure inclu sion and access for disadvantaged 
populations such as youth, low income citizens, dis abled, and the elderly. 
The functionality of each CTC location will be adap tive, based on the specific transportation and 
logistics needs of the community in which it exists . While each CTC will serve as a multimodal 
connecting point into and out of Atlanta’s existing  transportation systems, the mix of 
transportation modes, and the physical footprint of  the CTC, will vary based on its location, 
users and goals. Certain CTCs will place a focus on  connecting into regional transit and reducing 
regional commuter congestion. Others may focus more  specifically on in-town modalities such 
as walking and biking. CTCs located next to key bus iness hubs will also put more focus on 
freight transport and distribution.  
 
The CTC network solution provides five overarching benefits – each of which will be brought to 
life through a different combination of Smart City vision elements: 
1. People Mobility:  Moving quickly, seamlessly and safely throughout A tlanta. 
2. Commercial Agility:  Achieving greater delivery efficiency, improving a sset utilization, 
bringing logistics and distribution closer to urban  areas, and mobilizing the private sector to 
generate innovation in the domain.  
3. First/Last Mile Access:  Creating easy connections into and out of the CTC network to 
locations such as home, work, the grocery store or the doctor.  
 Atlanta Reimagined

 4. Connected People:  Using smarter tools to connect people to their tra nsportation, to their 
communities and to Atlanta. 
5. Vibrant Communities:  Rejuvenating neighborhoods by creating a vibrant, inviting 
community anchor point and reconnecting those neigh borhoods to the broader city. 
Solution Component 2 – The Smart City Command Cente r 
Supporting the operations of the CTC network will b e a Smart City Command Center (SCCC), 
which will aggregate all of the data coming in from  the CTC network, and other sources, and use 
it to make network operations as efficient as possi ble, generate new solutions and services, and 
enable integration of new modalities. 
In partnership with Georgia Tech, and leveraging Ge orgia Tech’s new High Performance 
Computing Center (HPCC), the SCCC will manage real- time data acquisition and analysis. The 
information that is gathered by the SCCC will be di gested, analyzed, and translated to deliver 
real-time, reliable and meaningful information to a ll stakeholders, who in-turn can make more-
informed decisions. In a sensing environment, the S CCC can work to make infrastructure assets 
become more self-aware and direct their own mainten ance, leading to condition-based 
maintenance, reduced down time and greater operatio nal efficiency of the infrastructure 
overall. In addition, the SCCC will serve as an inn ovation lab for the CTC network, gathering 
input on network user behavior and conducting live and virtual input and simulation sessions 
with citizens and other partners. 
The HPCC provides the perfect opportunity to bring this solution to life. Already under active 
development in Midtown Atlanta, the HPCC will be an  urban data center and a hub for 
establishing partnerships among the industry, acade mia, and the public sector centered around 
big data analytics. Included in the HPCC’s existing  development roadmap is a plan to create a 
cluster dedicated to Smart Cities, which will becom e the Smart City Command Center 
referenced above. The HPCC will allow us to: 
• Store the big data that will be collected in the im plementation phase of this project. 
• Provide data security & protect the data. 
• Provide direct, high-power computational access to the city much faster than any other 
cloud-based technology providers. 
• Analyze the data, build predictive, optimization an d simulation models, and create control 
tools for smart urban traffic and logistics managem ent systems. 
• Document the outcomes of research & disseminate res ults to the public domain. 
• Give access to the sanitized version of the dataset  to anybody who is interested in the 
research to help grow the adoption of smart hyper-c onnected transportation. 
• Provide a unique collaboration platform to attract and host the industry partners to the 
city’s smart transportation and logistics initiativ es. 
• Identify appropriate standards for all components –  data, infrastructure, applications, 
devices – and ensure adherence  Atlanta Reimagined

 Solution Component 3 – The Technology Infrastructur e Backbone 
Supporting both of the above solution components wi ll be the deployment of tens of thousands 
of sensors, controls, displays, and other devices a cross the city. This robust and well-designed 
network will enable the connectivity needed to supp ort data gathering, analytics and 
communications, bringing the entire network to life . To underpin this proposal, Atlanta is 
already deploying a city-scale, carrier-grade munic ipal fiber network. Through this network, 
Atlanta will be able to layer multiple technologies  and devices at critical points throughout the 
city. Our current vision includes 1 Gigabit fiber c onnections at most controlled intersections 
throughout the city. This will allow the city to de ploy the following technical equipment at 
every controlled intersection in the city: 
• Advanced traffic control systems 
• Advanced traffic monitoring systems 
• High resolution video cameras for security and oper ational purposes 
• Local video analytics for multiple purposes 
• Wi-Fi connectivity for operational, commercial, and  public needs 
• Environmental and other wide-ranging sensors for mo nitoring, communications and 
feedback 
Our Stories 
As you will see, our solution leverages the technol ogy capabilities of our region. Between the 
government, university and corporate expertise in o ur city, Atlanta can lay claim as a world-
class technology leader in logistics and transporta tion. Yet the real value of our solution will be 
measured by its impact on the lives of our people.  As we have worked to “Reimagine Atlanta,” 
we have continually thought of the individuals who live, work, and play in our city—the people 
who we serve and who, every day, deal with challeng es sometimes complicated by 
transportation systems that do not meet their needs . 
The stories below are the inspiration for the trans portation city of the future. While these six 
stories clearly communicate the benefits of a Reima gined Atlanta, there are many more stories 
like these that we could tell about people—from stu dents struggling to get to campus, to 
elderly citizens with limited mobility, to CEOs con sidering a move to Atlanta—whose lives and 
livelihoods would be improved through these efforts . 
• Tom Maggin – A struggling worker living in an under served community.  
o Current:  Every morning, Tom has to walk to catch the bus in  order to take 3 separate 
buses to get to his job in another part of city. De spite this arduous trek, a lack of 
mobility options prevents him from finding higher-q uality employment. 
o Future:  Tom rides his bike to the CTC, where it can be sto red securely. He is able to 
move quickly through the CTC smart corridors on a c onnected bus to the Beltline. Once 
he arrives, he takes an autonomous cart to the Nort heast side of city, where his job is 
located. Tom gets a subsidized ride share ride to h is office from his endpoint on the 
Beltline. On his way home from work, Tom picks up a  package containing his new work 
uniform at smart locker in the CTC.  Atlanta Reimagined 
 
9 
 o Benefits:  Tom’s commute time was cut in half, using safer tr avel modes. Tom is able 
travel to more parts of the city in order to find a  higher wage job better suited to his 
professional certification, and has greater access to urban resources. 
 
• Vanessa Hudgins – A young student, disconnected fro m affordable and safe 
transportation options, who struggles to get to sch ool on time  
o Current:  Vanessa is not served by school buses because she lives less than a mile from 
school. As a result, Vanessa has to get up early to  walk ¾ mile in the dark, early morning 
on a road without sidewalks to get to school. Both of Vanessa’s parents work early shifts 
and are unable to take her to school. To return hom e after school, Vanessa must go 
through the same process. 
o Future:  Vanessa is able to use a low-cost smart phone to f ind out when the next 
neighborhood automated shuttle pickup will be. The shuttle takes Vanessa and other 
students to the CTC, which is located near her high  school. Now, Vanessa only walks one 
block to get to school. At school, she is part of g roup project that uses CTC data to think 
of new ways of smartly getting students from their home to school. 
o Benefits:  Vanessa has a much safer commute. She can sleep lo nger, which helps to 
improve her academics. The CTC network itself augme nts learning for students and 
allows for applied research at school. 
 
• George Silva – A disabled senior citizen dealing ev ery day with inadequate access to 
transport for food and medicines. 
o Current:  George lives five miles from the nearest grocery s tore. To get there, he must 
call MARTA’s disability-friendly shuttle, which can  take a long time. George’s only other 
choice is to go to the convenience store on the cor ner, where he will pay more for his 
groceries with less selection. 
o Future:  George calls the nearest CTC and requests a ride. Depending on the volume of 
requests in his neighborhood, he can wait for an au tomated shuttle or take a subsidized 
ride share ride to the CTC. He moves via connected transit through a smart corridor to 
the CTC located near the grocery store. George rece ives a ride in an electrics car from 
the CTC to the grocery store. He shops for his groc eries and returns back to the CTC 
close to the grocery store, where he leaves his gro ceries. He then moves back through 
the corridor to his “home” CTC, where his prescript ion pills have been delivered and are 
waiting in the secure pharmacy pickup area. George picks up his pills and goes across 
street to his local urban farm, where he is able to  select more fresh produce. An 
autonomous shuttle drops him off back home. 15 minu tes later, his groceries, which 
were transported with other goods through the CTC n etwork, show up at his door. 
o Benefits:  George has increased mobility to and from home, as  well as more affordable 
access to better quality food. He is also able to c onveniently and securely pickup goods, 
such as his prescription pills, at the CTC. He can transport goods through the CTC, 
allowing him to shop without worrying about having to carry heavy items a long way. 
 
• Tonya Morris – A regional commuter who lives in a s uburb, 15 miles out of the city. Every 
day she must endure a long, stressful commute.  Atlanta Reimagined 
 
10 
 o Current:  Tonya wakes up at 6:00 am and leaves home without seeing her kids. She 
drives and sits in traffic for 90 minutes to get to  her downtown office. She tries taking 
the express bus, but it is not feasible because the  drop-off point is too far from her 
office to walk in her work clothes or in bad weathe r. 
o Future:  Tonya leaves home later, allowing her valuable tim e with her kids. She drives to 
the regional commuter CTC, which is located near th e city limits. Upon arrival, Tonya is 
automatically directed to an open parking spot wher e license plate recognition 
technology registers her license plate and charges her credit card. She takes a quick ride 
on the CTC express corridor bus to the Five Points CTC downtown. Her phone app 
recommends transportation modes from the final CTC to her office, based on weather 
and traffic. Today, Tonya uses a bike share bike an d arrives at her office in five minutes.  
o Benefits:  Tonya significantly reduced her commute time. The removal of her car from in-
town roads reduces overall rush hour congestion, im pact on infrastructure and the 
environment. Tonya is able to spend more time with her family.  
 
• Jamel Huff – Food services inventory manager at the  Georgia Aquarium, whose top 
priority is running smooth operations at one of Atl anta’s premier attractions. 
o Current: Jamel has an incoming order from one of the regiona l delivery companies. On-
time delivery is critical to make sure the various on-site food service operations remain 
fully stocked. As a result of bad traffic, the deli very is delayed, leading to bad 
experiences for the Aquarium guests and creating he adaches for Jamel.  
o Future:  To get the delivery to the Georgia Aquarium, the t ruck driver drives to a CTC 
near the perimeter of the city that specializes in freight distribution. While inbound to 
Atlanta, the truck automatically notifies the CTC o f its location and projected arrival 
time. Immediately upon arrival, specialized robots,  operated by UPS, automatically 
offload a modular container from the truck. On-dema nd transport vehicles receive data 
from in-town sensors and are automatically routed i n the most efficient way to the 
Aquarium, allowing them to arrive at the exact time  specified for delivery and keeping 
Jamel’s operation running smoothly. 
o Benefits:  The Aquarium’s costs are reduced by being able to plan more accurately for 
tighter delivery windows, and Jamel’s customers are  more satisfied. Additionally, 
Atlanta’s roadways are less damaged by heavy truck wear and tear. Congestion and 
pollution are reduced, improving the quality of lif e in urban spaces.  
 
• Samuel Wright – A CEO who is weighing the assets an d liabilities of relocating his global 
technology business to Atlanta. 
o Current:  Sam’s company is relocating from a large, northeas tern city due to high costs of 
operation. Sam and his team consider Atlanta. The e xisting business core of the city 
proves too expensive, and tax incentives are not la rge enough to make a difference. The 
company rules out relocating to other parts of the city because they lack transportation 
options for employees and the areas are perceived a s dangerous. The company decides 
to relocate to a different city. 
o Future:  Sam’s company examines relocating to the west end of Atlanta, near a CTC. It 
offers ready access to the employment base and good s supply of the entire city. By 
relocating near a CTC, the company will also be abl e to take advantage of networked 
public safety cameras, improved street lighting and  a mini-police precinct located near  Atlanta Reimagined 
 
11 
 the CTC. In addition, the cost of land and other op erations remain significantly lower 
than in the urban core. The company decides to relo cate to the west side, bringing 500 
new jobs into the city and further increasing the m omentum of residents and job 
seekers relocating to the west side of city. 
o Benefits:  New employment is attracted to Atlanta. The cost o f doing business within 
Atlanta in decreased, and business development is l ess reliant on tax-based incentives. 
Relocating residents are encouraged to fill in the areas outside of Atlanta’s existing inner 
urban core. 
Implementation and Program Management Approach 
Atlanta will follow best practices and incorporate key learnings from its $250M Renew Atlanta 
infrastructure bond program to employ a best practi ce program management approach. 
Prior to implementation, the City will select and h ire a Program Management Team (PMT) with 
project management expertise in both construction a nd technology implementation. This PMT 
shall report through the governance structure outli ned in a below section. The PMT will be 
responsible for day-to-day program management, incl uding project management, resource 
allocation, budget management and partner coordinat ion. 
In tandem with our proposed governance process, the  PMT approach will ensure that projects 
are completed on time, within budget and to standar d. 
2 – Atlanta’s Key Characteristics 
The city of Atlanta had a 2010 Census population of  420,003 people (The 2014 Census 
estimated a population of 456,002 people, or over 8 % growth). Atlanta has a land area of 
133.15 square miles, which translates to a populati on density of 3,154.3 persons per square 
mile as of 2010. 
The 2010 Population of Atlanta’s Urbanized Area was  4,515,419 people. Atlanta’s UZA Land 
Area is 2681.0 square miles, which translates to a UZA population density of 1684.2 persons per 
square mile. Also as of 2010, the city of Atlanta’s  population as a percentage of its UZA was 
9.3%. The city’s land area as a percentage of its U ZA was 5.0%. 
Atlanta’s population increases significantly during  the daytime, in terms of absolute numbers, 
density, and as a percentage of the UZA. The 2010 C ensus estimated that the city’s population 
increases by 66% (~273,000 people) during the dayti me, the second largest increase of any city 
in the US with over 250,000 residents. In other wor ds, during the daytime, Atlanta’s population 
as a percentage of its UZA jumps to ~15%. 
This massive daily influx of commuters into the cit y poses many challenges relevant to this 
proposal: The city’s infrastructure is supported by  a tax base significantly smaller than the daily 
user base; commute times are some of the longest in  the country; congestion clogs roads, 
harms the environment, reduces quality of life, and  increases costs for people and businesses. 
In the context of this challenge, we believe these characteristics to be an advantage for Atlanta. 
Atlanta is uniquely positioned as both a relatively  dense city that has the critical mass to test  Atlanta Reimagined 
 
12 
 and scale smart transportation solutions, while als o still having the potential to reap the 
benefits of significantly increased resident densit y. Most cities can only claim one or the other. 
We believe that our proposal will enable Atlanta to  generate and handle greater round-the-
clock density—thus alleviating the challenges descr ibed above—by providing connectivity to 
disconnected communities, driving development, and generating the influx of visitors and 
residents needed to create smart, dense urban envir onments that will help the city to thrive in 
the years to come. We also believe that this can be  done while minimizing the need to build 
significant costly new public physical infrastructu re to achieve it. 
3 – Other characteristics of Atlanta 
While Atlanta, and the state of Georgia, has histor ically ranked extremely low in per capita state 
transit funding, recent efforts have significantly boosted overall transportation funding at the 
state and municipal levels, making Atlanta a locati on ripe for new, bold strategies. 
In 2015, Atlanta voters approved a referendum allow ing Atlanta to issue a $250M bond with 
the purpose of upgrading infrastructure across the city. This program is known as Renew 
Atlanta. Also in 2015, the Georgia Legislature pass ed HB 170, the Transportation Funding Act of 
2015. This bill is expected to generate $900 millio n in annual, dedicated transportation funding. 
Atlanta’s public transportation is currently manage d by the Metro Atlanta Rapid Transit 
Authority, known as MARTA. Within city limits, MART A operates a rail system containing 2 main 
lines (North to South, East to West) that include 2  minor branch lines. The system has 24 train 
stations within the city. MARTA also operates 407 b us routes that contain a total of 4,308 stops. 
MARTA, a key partner in implementing Atlanta’s prop osed solution, has demonstrated its ability 
to manage a fiscally and operationally sound organi zation. According to their data, MARTA has 
posted three back-to-back years of budget surpluses  and has $200 million in reserves. Year over 
year ridership increased from 129 million to 136 mi llion passenger rides last fiscal year. On-time 
performance for buses and trains in 2015 was 96 per cent. In addition, this year MARTA is asking 
the state General Assembly to allow a referendum on  a half-percent sales tax in Fulton and 
DeKalb counties to fund an estimated $4B of an $8B planned expansion to MARTA’s train 
network in metro Atlanta. 
Atlanta and Georgia have demonstrated commitments t o integrate with the sharing economy. 
In 2015, GA Governor Nathan Deal signed into law HB  225, which set uniform statewide 
operational requirements for for-hire vehicles, inc luding ride share companies. The bill, which 
filled existing gaps in state law regarding insuran ce coverage and passenger safety in the for-
hire industry, was supported by prominent ride shar e companies such as Uber and Lyft. The City 
of Atlanta complied soon after by updating its char ter to accommodate the regulatory changes, 
ensuring smooth operation of ride share companies w ithin the city. In addition, Hartsfield-
Jackson Atlanta International Airport is currently developing a policy framework that will allow 
ride share companies to operate at the world’s busi est airport. 
Led by the efforts of Mayor Kasim Reed, the City of  Atlanta has also made significant progress in 
making its data open, machine-readable and accessib le, discoverable and usable by the public.  Atlanta Reimagined 
 
13 
 In 2015, the Mayor’s Office of Innovation Delivery and Performance (MOIDP) launched 
DataAtlanta, a portal allowing access to all of the  city’s publically-accessible performance data. 
MOIDP also launched Atlanta’s first ever public-fac ing performance website, delivering on the 
Mayor’s commitment to make the City’s performance m ore transparent. 
Because of these and other efforts, Atlanta is curr ently ranked 17 out of 109 cities in the 
amount of open data that it delivers. This ranking is compiled by the Open Data Census, a joint 
effort by the non-profits Code For America and The Sunlight Foundation. 
These efforts by our leaders are clear demonstratio ns of Atlanta’s commitment and capacity to 
carry out our demonstration projects throughout the  period of performance. 
In addition to all of the characteristics listed ab ove, Atlanta has many more advantages that 
make it conducive to being a Smart City, including:  
• Managed Lanes:  The number of average daily trips using the I-85 H OT lanes increased from 
18,960 in April of 2013 to 20,141 in April of 2014.  
• World Class Air Travel:  Atlanta is home to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Inte rnational airport, 
the world’s busiest airport for passengers. In 2015 , passenger traffic at HJAIA topped 
100,000,000 passengers, a first for any airport in the world. 
• Roadway Safety:  From 2008 to 2012, the 18-County region experience d a decrease of 
fatalities on the public roadways, from 528 in 2008  to 452 in 2012. 
• Georgia is the #4 state in the nation for jobs attr ibuted to the app economy , numbering 
24,000 in 2012 according to CTIA. TechNet places At lanta in the top 10 metro areas for the 
highest percentage of app economy jobs.  
• Approximately 70% of all credit and debit transacti ons that occur in the US are handled by 
companies based in Georgia , predominantly in metro Atlanta (Source: Global Pa yments) 
• Four of America’s top FinTech companies are headqua rtered in Georgia : NCR, First Data, 
TSYS, Equifax (American Banker) 
• Atlanta ranks third in the nation among cities with  the most FORTUNE 500 Headquarters, 
according to the 2013 FORTUNE list. These companies include Coca-Cola, Delta Air Lines,  
The Home Depot, UPS, First Data Corporation, NCR an d The Southern Company. 
• Key Universities  include Georgia Tech, Georgia State, Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities, and Emory University. This includes G eorgia Tech’s Advanced Technology 
Development Center and High Performance Computing C enter.

Please see the final page of this document, prior t o letters of support, for a full-sized map. 
5 – Smart City elements 
Atlanta’s 3-tiered Smart City solution includes pro jects related to all 12 of U.S. DOT’s vision 
elements, bringing them together in a cohesive fash ion. Below, we have listed each element 
and the projects that come underneath it. The site map at the end of the document serves as a  Atlanta Reimagined 
 
14 
 companion to this section, demonstrating how projec ts will come together under a unified 
structure. 
As stated in the solution overview in section 1, th ese projects will deliver benefits related to 
People Mobility, Commercial Agility, First/Last Mil e Access, Connected People and Vibrant 
Communities.  
Vision Element #1: Urban Automation 
• People Mobility 
o In partnership with the Georgia Road and Tollway Au thority (GRTA), driver-assisted 
autonomous regional express transit buses can deliv er commuters from regional 
transportation points into commuter-focused CTCs. A utomation is feasible because of 
the relatively fixed routes and mostly freeway driv ing done by these buses. 
o Transportation around the Beltline CTC in slow movi ng autonomous carts, allowing 
users to hop on and off. 
• First/Late Mile Access 
o Driver-assisted autonomous delivery trucks, powered  by companies such as UPS and 
Mercedes, can complete last-mile delivery of reside ntial packages.  
o Automated, wheelchair-accessible shuttle buses can serve neighborhoods within each 
CTC’s defined collection areas. Because routes are fixed, automation of these shuttles is 
feasible within a reasonable timeframe.  
o A pilot autonomous drone project can be used to fac ilitate last-mile delivery of 
residential packages from a CTC in areas where airs pace is unrestricted.  
• Commercial Agility 
o At logistically-specialized CTCs, advanced robotics  can be used for unloading large 
freight deliveries and staging for outbound transpo rtation. 
o Autonomous freight movement vehicles can be used to  move freight within a CTC from 
offloading area and into a staging area for departu re. 
o Driver-assisted movement of freight can be automate d within the smart corridor from 
the Aerotropolis to the airport. The closeness of t hese facilities provides a realistic 
proving ground for automation. 
Vision Element #2: Connected Vehicles 
• People Mobility 
o On-demand transportation modalities, such as connec ted buses, cars, bikes and carts 
will be alerted to come to CTC nodes when a critica l mass of arriving or departing people 
is reached for transportation. 
o Smart corridor mass transit vehicles will be enable d with Dedicated Short Range 
Communications. This will enable these vehicles to improve breaking, increase accident 
avoidance, deliver greater fuel efficiency, and eve ntually move as a platoon. 
o Signal priority technology will communicate with co nnected buses to create a 
continuously-moving travel path. 
• Commercial Agility  Atlanta Reimagined 
 
15 
 o Connected package distribution vehicles will be ale rted to come to CTC nodes when 
critical mass of packages is reached for delivery. 
o Connected freight trucks will communicate arrival t imes to freight CTC nodes, allowing 
for efficient use of delivery space and preparation  of automated robotics for offloading 
and staging. The trucks can be routed to arrive at a freight CTC at a pre-specified time. 
• Connected People 
o Connected modes of transportation to the CTC from a  starting point will be able to 
adjust routes based on amount of people waiting to be picked up. They will then be able 
to communicate projected pickup times back to users . 
Vision Element #3: Intelligent, Sensor-Based Infras tructure 
• People Mobility 
o For CTCs serving heavy regional commuter bases, fre e flow parking applications 
powered by smart parking sensors at the CTC will ge t cars off the streets and into a spot 
faster, reducing pollution and improving the experi ence of CTC utilization 
o Sensors and traffic management software along smart  corridors will route buses and 
other transit modalities in the most effective way between points 
o Sensors will also support traffic light synchroniza tion within smart corridors. This 
signalization, supported by lane-level traffic flow  sensing, will allow vehicles to achieve 
the fastest feasible travel times within corridors.  
• Commercial Agility 
o Sensors at freight-specialized CTCs will allow for automatic data collection related to 
freight size and weight, as well as arrival, unload ing, loading and departure times. This 
will allow for improved planning of freight staging  and delivery clustering. 
o Sensors along the smart corridors will allow for tr acking of freight logistics vehicles and 
their transported modular containers, allowing ubiq uitous tracking and visibility of 
logistics flows across the urban network. 
• First/Last Mile Access 
o Sensors in key collection areas around CTC nodes wi ll gather data that can recommend 
an appropriate last mile connectivity mode based on  traffic, weather, and numerous 
other factors.  
• Connected People 
o Sensors placed at key points within CTC collection zones will allow for real-time 
monitoring of conditions coming into CTC. Citizens will be alerted to updated arrival 
times at the CTC, or routed to another CTC in case of accident, incident or congestion. 
o A variety of already-available sensor technologies can deliver accurate travel time 
calculations, along with updated arrival and depart ure information. 
• Vibrant Communities 
o In and around CTCs, sensor-embedded surveillance ca meras and lights will improve 
monitoring and safety, adjusting coverage based on current locations of people and 
vehicles in and around the vicinity. Cameras will b e linked into the Atlanta Police 
Department’s existing Video Integration Center, all owing for easy communication 
should a public safety issue arise.  Atlanta Reimagined 
 
16 
 Vision Element #4: Urban Analytics 
• People Mobility 
o The Smart City Command Center can use real-time dat a on travel patterns to test the 
effectiveness of different routing options within s mart corridors, allowing buses to 
adjust travel schedules and routes while also enabl ing improved traffic signalization. 
o The SCCC will also use existing platforms to expose  sanitized open data to the public, 
allowing for the crowd-sourced development of addit ional travel apps and technology. 
o SCCC open data will enable improved real-time alert s and rerouting of commuters 
during peak congestion times. 
• Commercial agility 
o The SCCC can analyze freight data from routings alo ng the network and deliveries at the 
CTC, identifying sources of freight congestion. Thi s analysis will feed predictive modeling 
of future deliveries, enabling more efficient trans portation management and shipping 
consolidation. 
o Efficient freight-specific routes can be identified  in real-time and transmitted to delivery 
trucks’ navigation systems 
Vision Element #5: User-Focused Mobility Services a nd Choices 
• Connected People 
o The concept of Mobility As A Service (MAAS) can be used within CTC collection zones to 
collect people via different modes of transportatio n depending on their travel needs. 
Automated shuttles can run at preset times, while m ore nimble on-demand 
transportation modes can be dispatched for more urg ent or resource-intensive travel 
needs (e.g. – disabled citizens). 
o A suite of apps, or possibly a single integrated ap p, will assist users with full journey 
planning, vehicle (or other modality) reservations,  real-time location, duration and ETA 
information, and, if necessary, payment.  
o Users will be able to input travel preferences via both app and phone, allowing for 
mobility regardless of technical capability. 
• Commercial Agility 
o At CTC nodes handling freight, logistics software c an foster adoption of digital methods 
for exchanging shipping documentation and payment 
o Residential packages can be either stored at smart lockers within CTCs or delivered 
directly to a residence, depending on user preferen ce 
• First/Last Mile Access 
o Residential packages can be either stored at smart lockers within CTCs or delivered 
directly to a residence, depending on user preferen ce.  
o Last mile transportation from CTCs can vary based o n current weather, traffic and other 
input data collected from sensor network.  
Vision Element #6: Urban Delivery and Logistics 
• Commercial agility  Atlanta Reimagined 
 
17 
 o The CTC network can be exploited to place goods in modular containers at an initial CTC, 
and then ship goods iteratively to CTCs until reach ing a final CTC near their destination.  
o The sensor-based, connected vehicle and urban analy tics solutions described above can 
come together to allow for a decreased number of ur ban delivery vehicles to deliver 
more packages in a faster time than is possible tod ay.  
• First/Last Mile Access 
o Smart lockers at CTC nodes will store packages secu rely for residential pick up.  
o These shared community distribution points will cat alyze even more innovative services 
to facilitate last mile delivery.  
o CTCs with more intensive freight capabilities will be located based on key retail and 
commercial delivery hubs within Atlanta. 
o On-demand, crowd-sourced delivery services can be u sed to ship goods from the CTCs 
to their final destination, be it a household, a sm art locker or a business. 
Vision Element #7: Strategic Business Models and Pa rtnering Opportunities

18 
 /square4 Leveraging State Bill HB 170, the Transportation Fu nding Act of 2015, to finance any 
infrastructure improvements required to implement t hese solutions. 
/square4 Using the Tax Allocation District (TAD) model to fi nance development of CTC nodes.  
/square4 Using funding from Atlanta’s Community Improvement Districts and Regional Planning 
Commission to finance development of both CTC nodes  and smart corridors.  
Vision Element #8: Smart Grid, Roadway Electrificat ion, and Electric Vehicles 
• People Mobility 
o Commuter-specialized CTCs will contain charging sta tions for electric vehicles parked 
therein. Depending on feasibility, they can also co ntain wirelessly charging parking 
spaces. Electricity will be drawn from street or mo st convenient source. 
o Non-manual transportation at all points (pickup, in -network, distribution) can be 
electrified. This includes shuttles, buses, cars an d slow-moving carts. 
• Commercial Agility 
o The short corridor between the Aerotropolis and air port can become a fully-electrified 
roadway via wireless inductive charging, allowing f or autonomous, electric and constant 
movement of freight between the two points. 
• Vibrant Communities 
o LED street lights near CTCs and along smart corrido rs will connect directly into Georgia 
Power’s smart grid network, allowing for efficient use of energy.  
Vision Element #9: Connected, Involved Citizens 
• Connected People 
o Mobility As A Service will enable citizens to reduc e overall travel times to and from 
destinations. It will also enable citizens of all d egrees of technological capability to 
access the CTC network. 
o The Smart City Command Center, in addition to servi ng as the analytic nerve center of 
this proposal, will conduct regular transportation ideation sessions with citizens. These 
sessions will build upon a citizen ideation session  model already in place at the Airport, 
gathering qualitative citizen input and using it to  augment learnings from data analysis. 
o In partnership with Atlanta Public Schools and Geor gia Tech, we will expand Georgia 
Tech’s existing City as Lab  project, which brings real city-focused data and i ssues into 
the classroom. Students will be challenged to analy ze and solve existing issues that city’s 
face, providing a win-win for both the students and  the city. 
o The Smart City Command Center will expose its open transportation data to the public, 
allowing for exponential development of currently u nknown transportation solutions.  
Vision Element #10: Architecture and Standards 
• In order to deliver maximum usage of this infrastru cture, Atlanta will make the new system 
environment completely compatible with current and future ITS architecture standards and 
all other applicable technical and security standar ds, including CVRIA. Given that the 
network will comprise of a large number of heteroge neous devices, standards applicability 
will be required at the following levels:  Atlanta Reimagined 
 
19 
 o Device level 
o Group level (groups of homogeneous and spatially si milar devices) 
o Departmental level (all devices controlled by one d epartment within an entity) 
o Corporate/Agency level (all devices controlled by o ne company or agency) 
o Regional level (all devices of a singular type irre spective of controlling company/agency) 
o Global level (interaction with the municipal networ k irrespective of type or ownership) 
• As devices, functions, and configurations are ident ified, we will work with the appropriate 
stakeholders to ensure that all applicable federal,  state, and local standards are maintained. 
• We will also seek to employ a federated network mod el that recognizes most devices on the 
network will be privately owned or owned by specifi c government agencies with little or no 
relationship with other participants in the network . 
Vision Element #11: Low-Cost, Efficient, Secure, an d Resilient Information and 
Communications Technology 
• The Smart City Command Center will allow for develo pment and testing of best-in-class 
security protocols related to storing and managing transportation data 
• We will also support implementation of U.S. DOT’s S CMS wherever possible 
• Existing LED streetlight retrofitting efforts, muni cipal fiber network, and newly-developed 
Google Fiber network, can be leveraged to connect a nd network physical infrastructure 
backbone of the proposal at a relatively low cost 
• We will employ a minimum 4 tier security model for all network devices (control and data) 
to allow for information to be shared: (1) Only wit hin the controlling department; (2) 
Throughout the controlling agency/company/instituti on; (3) Across agencies and companies 
within the municipal cloud; (4) Publicly available to all parties irrespective of affiliation. 
• Device level security monitoring and audit function s to reflect current state and previous 
state changes logged for analysis.  
Vision Element #12: Smart Land Use 
• Vibrant Communities  
o New CTC nodes will be developed around existing phy sical infrastructure, eliminating 
the need to fully construct any new physical buildi ngs to serve as a CTC. 
o CTC nodes will promote urban agriculture in select areas, allowing for easy access to 
fresh produce for those who live in food deserts. 
o Building on Atlanta’s existing Better Buildings Cha llenge program and solar panel rollout, 
CTC buildings will be LEED certified and at least p artially powered via solar technology. 
o Overall, the CTC network minimizes the need for new  built transportation infrastructure, 
including bridges, roads and rail. Instead, the net work focuses on improving the use of 
existing infrastructure to achieve the goals of thi s proposal. Because of this, the program 
is feasibly scalable to a regional, and even nation al, level. 
o Housing policies will encourage development of affo rdable housing, reducing risk of 
“gentrification” in CTC areas that further push out  underserved communities. 
o Zoning policies around CTCs will be updated to enco urage mixed-use development and 
walkable spaces.  Atlanta Reimagined

 6- Key technical, policy, and institutional risks a nd mitigation plans 
Technical 
Technology implementation (High) 
As with most large-scale technology implementation projects, the complexity of 
implementation poses a significant risk to overruns  of time and budget, and a failure to achieve 
results. We understand the need to engage in a risk  mitigation strategy to prevent project 
delays and/or funding misallocations. We will ident ify, quantify and prioritize the most 
important risks as well as returns on a systematic basis, using a combination of quantitative and 
qualitative methods.  
To mitigate, we will set up a risk governance struc ture to maintain command over the 
program’s risk profile and operational needs. Some methods we plan to employ include: risk 
measurement scoping, analytic modeling and stress t esting, portfolio adjustments, and risk-
based pricing.  More routine processes we also plan  to utilize are: daily management reporting, 
weekly planning, and capital allocation and daily f rontline transactions, such as contract 
structuring and pricing.  Ultimately, we will ensur e that with our validated approaches, we will 
have better clarity and insights to the projects po rtfolio of risks and how to use these insights to 
improve strategic, financial, and operational decis ion making for Beyond Traffic: Atlanta. 
Technology development/feasibility (High) 
It is possible that some of the technologies propos ed in our solution may not become 
commercially available within currently-expected ti meframes. It is also possible that one or 
more of these technologies will not be as feasible to implement as expected when detailed 
implementation planning is undertaken. Either way, the result is that a technology listed in our 
proposal will not be able to be implemented. 
The risk governance structure above will allow us t o identify and address technology 
development risks as soon as possible. Additionally , our close partnership with Georgia Tech 
will provide us with better insight into advanced t echnology development pipelines, allowing us 
to adjust the program roadmap before a critical poi nt is reached. 
Security (High) 
Our proposal entails connectedness and data gatheri ng at a scope and scale not currently seen 
in many cities, if any at all. The integration of l arge amounts of data from so many sources will 
pose myriad security challenges, particularly aroun d autonomous and connected vehicles. 
We recognize that specialized expertise will be req uired to implement a security framework 
that protects the safety and the privacy of our sta keholders. In this respect, our partnership 
with Georgia Tech will again be critical.  Georgia Tech and their Georgia Tech Research Institute 
have Department of Defense-level experience in secu ring these types of networks.  No other 
city could provide the Security First elements that  Atlanta can to advanced Smart City networks.  Atlanta Reimagined 
 
21 
 Policy 
Lack of coherent autonomous vehicle policy (Medium)  
Perhaps the greatest policy risk of this proposal i s the lack of a unified national regulatory 
framework around autonomous vehicles. This framewor k must be in place before we can 
implement autonomous vehicle projects at scale. Thi s risk is mitigated by the fact that 
autonomous vehicles within our proposal can be repl aced by smart, connected, driver-assisted 
vehicles. While our proposal will significantly ben efit from autonomous vehicle technology and 
policy, its success is not solely reliant on these factors. 
Privacy (Medium) 
Big data collection may trigger concerns about the privacy of personal data. As we implement 
this solution, we will endeavor to use data privacy  best practices and consult with industry 
experts to develop privacy policies that balance th e need for privacy with the need for data to 
operate effectively. We will ensure that this devel opment process contains extensive citizen 
feedback, and we will work to sign MOUs with releva nt partners to ensure compliance with 
these policies. 
Supporting land use and zoning policies (Low) 
Development in and around CTCs will require changes  to city zoning, land use and affordable 
housing policies. Enacting these policy changes wil l be a critical success factor of the proposal. 
Because these changes can be enacted at a City leve l, we are confident in our ability to work 
with the Atlanta City Council and Department of Pla nning and Community Development to 
enact required zoning, housing and land use policy changes. 
Institutional 
Support of partners through implementation (Low) 
Implementation of this plan will depend on the supp ort of many key partners, both public and 
private. Two critical partners in this venture will  be MARTA and Georgia Tech. While both have 
indicated support for this proposal, it is always p ossible that the implementation details of the 
solution and changing macroeconomic factors could c hange that level of support. 
To address this, we plan to work closely with both of these partners during planning, making 
them both part of the core team as we develop imple mentation plans. In this way, we will be 
able to address and mitigate and critical disagreem ents as early as possible. 
The fiscal health of both of these organizations sh ould mitigate any risk of shifting priorities 
based on macroeconomic conditions. Georgia Tech has  also already demonstrated its 
commitment to partner with Atlanta by joining the c ity in a MetroLab partnership. 
Changes in leadership (Low) 
Mayor Kasim Reed will leave office in January 2018.  By law, he cannot run for another term. It is 
possible that a new Mayor will decide to halt imple mentation of this proposal.  Atlanta Reimagined 
 
22 
 We believe this risk to be low. The amount of econo mic and social benefit generated by the 
solutions proposed herein will be large enough that  it will be counter-productive to halt 
implementation halfway through. In addition, the At lanta City Council has demonstrated its 
commitment to this plan, voting unanimously to supp ort our proposal prior to this submission. 
7- Partners, Key Stakeholders, and Demonstration Go vernance 
Processes 
Partners 
This proposal will enlist the support of myriad par tners, both public and private. As outlined 
before, key partners will include Georgia Tech, to help bring to life the Smart City Command 
Center, and MARTA, to help operate transit through the CTC corridors and augment existing 
transit hubs with CTC technology. 
Georgia Tech, through its Supply Chain and Logistic s Interdisciplinary Research Center and its 
Physical Internet Center, is a leader in smart hype r-connected city logistics and urban mobility. 
It is also a leader in autonomous vehicle research as well as in transportation analytics and 
policy research. They will be a key partner in the development and implementation of many of 
the projects described above. 
Other key public partners will include: 
• The Atlanta Beltline, to help augment the Beltline with CTC technology 
• Invest Atlanta, Atlanta’s development authority, to  encourage business development at and 
around CTCs. 
• Atlanta Public Schools, to provide input into CTC l ocations and design programming for the 
proposed City As Lab  project expansion. 
• The Atlanta Regional Commission, to provide plannin g, research and policy support. 
• Atlanta’s Community Improvement Districts, to help plan and implement CTC technology. 
• The GA Department of Transportation, to help plan a nd implement multiple facets of this 
solution. 
In addition to providing much of the technology und erlying this proposal, private partners will 
also be critical in the planning and implementation  of each solution. Key private partners will 
include: 
• UPS, to help design freight-specialized CTCs and lo gistics delivery networks. 
• Georgia Power, to plan for roadway electrification and additional vehicle charging stations. 
• AT&T, a strategic partner with Atlanta, to help des ign our network of connected sensors. 
• Multiple large and small technology-focused compani es to provide enabling technologies 
that support this proposal. 
It should be noted that most all of the stakeholder s above have indicated their support for this 
proposal, as evidenced by the letters of support at tached to this document.   Atlanta Reimagined 
 
23 
 Stakeholders  
Atlanta’s biggest stakeholders are its people, and we have not succeeded if we do not deliver 
our proposed outcomes for them. Other stakeholders include: 
• Governments and citizens of municipalities surround ing Atlanta. Some of them (i.e. – 
commuters) will be directly impacted by this work, while others will serve as interested 
parties, possibly helping to expand this solution a cross the region should it prove successful. 
• Multiple Federal Departments and Agencies, whose po licy and regulatory guidance will be 
critical in achieving these goals. Atlanta commits to stay connected with these agencies and 
serve as a testing ground for framework design wher e necessary. 
• Technology companies interested in testing new tech nology in Atlanta’s cutting edge CTC 
network. Atlanta is open for business and welcomes all companies that wish to make us 
their base of operations. 
Demonstration Governance Processes 
Atlanta has multiple options for governance of solu tion demonstration. A recommended 
structure will be specified as more detailed implem entation approaches are developed in Phase 
II of this challenge. At a high level, potential go vernance options include: 
1. Placing governance responsibility underneath an Exe cutive Director of Smart City 
Implementation, reporting directly to the Mayor of Atlanta. This approach has been 
successful with the implementation of projects unde r the aegis of the $250M Renew 
Atlanta Infrastructure Bond, which report into a Re new Atlanta Executive Director. This 
approach will allow for tighter control of project timelines and costs, but may make 
coordination across entities more difficult. 
2. Establishing a separate 501(c)(3) responsible for g overnance. This method was employed to 
manage a variety of Atlanta initiatives to address homelessness and poverty. This approach 
will facilitate easier cross-organizational partici pation, but may make it more difficult for the 
city to directly control project timelines and cost s. 
Regardless of the selected process, the City will w ork to establish an overall demonstration 
governance board, consisting of members from all ke y partners. This board will meet at least 
monthly, and more frequently if necessary, to revie w progress, make key implementation 
decisions and address any unforeseen challenges tha t may arise. 
8- Existing Transportation Infrastructure and Syste m Features 
Roadways 
Atlanta contains 459.8 arterial road miles and 513. 1 arterial lane miles. Atlanta also contains 
459.8 freeway miles and 1,256.7 freeway lane miles.  
Transit Services  
In addition to MARTA, described in detail in an abo ve section, Atlanta is also serviced by the 
following transit services.  Atlanta Reimagined 
 
24 
 Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (“ HJAIA”) 
Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (A TL/Airport) is the world’s busiest airport, 
handling over 100,000,000 million incoming and outg oing passengers aboard more than 
880,000 aircraft operations. It is the principle ai r carrier airport servicing both Georgia and the 
Southeastern United States. The Airport occupies a 4,750-acre site in Clayton and Fulton 
counties, approximately ten miles south of downtown  Atlanta. Two major airlines use ATL as a 
key airport in their operations, Delta Air Lines an d Southwest Airlines. The direct regional 
economic impact of the Airport in total business re venue estimated to be more than $34.8 
billion annually, with an indirect and induced impa ct of $29.5 billion annually. 
Atlanta Streetcar 
Phase I of the Atlanta streetcar opened for use in December 2014. Phase I consists of an initial 
2.7 miles. In the coming years, additional lines ar e planned, and project developers intend to 
expand service to additional neighborhoods and othe r popular destinations around the city. 
Georgia Regional Transportation Authority (“GRTA”)  
GRTA is a transit provider for all of metro Atlanta  with its Xpress bus and vanpool services. 
GRTA also administers the Atlanta region’s vanpool program, which provides an additional 
transportation option for commuters in approximatel y 33 counties, who use the daily vanpool 
service to travel to major employment centers throu ghout the region. 
Cobb County Transit (“CCT”)  
CCT services a population of about 730,981 in Cobb County, GA, providing regional connectivity 
to MARTA. CCT’s buses in 2015 provided service for a reported 2,487,129 passenger trips. CCT 
operates 89 Full size buses on 16 bus routes coveri ng approximately 10,734 miles per day. CCT 
has over 751 bus stops including 293 bus shelters. CCT’s Paratransit service operates 25 lift-
equipped vans and 5 Flex service vans with 58,916 p assenger trips in 2015. 
Shared-use mobility services 
A number of shared-use mobility services have signifi cant operations within Atlanta, including 
Uber, Lyft, Zip Car, the Clean Air Campaign shared rides, and vRide. 
Information and communication technology (ICT)  
Atlanta is well positioned technically to realize a  challenge of this magnitude. The City already 
has the following in place: 
• A state-of-the-art Video Integration Center that in tegrates and uses smart analytics 
technology to provide 24/7 monitoring of over 6,000  (and growing) public and private 
sector cameras from across the city. 
• Over 9,000 laptops, desktops, and computing devices . 
• Multi county radio network supporting 9,200 users. 
• Server capacity of 600+ physical and virtualized co mputer servers and nearly 200 
applications in the municipal portfolio 
• 112 miles of owned and shared fiber available for m unicipal usage.  Atlanta Reimagined 
 
25 
 In addition to the existing technical portfolio, th e City has plans already underway to modernize 
and interconnect nearly 1,000 intersections, corrid ors, and key facilities with nearly 150 
additional miles of a carrier-grade municipal fiber  network. This investment will give the city 
over 250 miles of Gigabit+ speeds, spare capacity, and Wi-Fi for multiple operational and 
commercial needs, and the communications capabiliti es necessary to deploy a city-scale level of 
smart technology enabling the enhanced transportati on solutions outlined in this proposal.  
Atlanta consistently ranks at the top of Forbes’ “M ost Wired Cities in the US” list (last ranked at 
#2), enjoying 74% broadband adoption, 18 broadband providers, and 11, 342 WiFi hotspots.  
According to the Technology Association of Georgia,  Atlanta’s telecom infrastructure is ranked 
among the top five U.S. markets for total bandwidth  and fiber access, in part because two of 
the country’s largest fiber routes cross in metro A tlanta. Because of this and many other 
reasons, metro Atlanta has a thriving ecosystem of communications service providers. 
 
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) 
The table below from the Georgia Department of Tran sportation provides ITS data for the 
Atlanta MPO Area, as of 2010: 
ATMS Components  Year 2010

Smart Grid Infrastructure including electric vehicl e charging infrastructure 
Georgia Power (a division of Southern Company) has invested heavily in Smart Grid and 
Automated Metering Infrastructure (AMI) in Atlanta.  The Smart Grid’s intelligent devices, 
communications network, and advanced applications e nable several advantages such as 
increasing grid reliability, improving safety capab ilities and enhancing customer communication 
and interaction. Georgia Power has completed an inv estment in and deployment of AMI 
enabling automation of service connections and disc onnects, meter tampering identification 
and service quality issues. Additionally the infras tructure provides a platform for enhanced 
services including the customer monitoring and mana ging their residential energy usage. 
There are 149 charging stations throughout Atlanta.  In 2010, Southern Company accepted 
$165M as part of the Smart Grid Investment Grant wi th U.S. Department of Energy. 
9 – Data currently collected 
Currently, the following data is collected relating  to traffic in and around Atlanta: 
• The City regularly collects 24 hour traffic volume counts from high trafficked areas. Over the 
past 24 months, the city collected traffic counts a t 154 distinct locations. 
• The Atlanta Regional commission collects traffic da ta at 98 distinct bottleneck locations in 
and around the Atlanta metro area. 
• The Georgia Department of Transportation collects a nd provides real-time data online so 
Atlanta drivers can plan their commute. 
The City also collects operational data from multip le other sources, including: 
• Data on each call placed to the City’s 311 customer  service center, including call time, 
length, call type, Department affected, and Service  Request type (if applicable).  
• Record-level data from the City’s work order manage ment systems, including detailed 
information on work completion progress for 200+ me trics across multiple departments. 
• Record-level data on crime and emergency response i ncidents. 
• Record-level data on all calls placed to the City’s  e911 call center. 
• Individual case data from the City’s Municipal Cour t. 
• Building permit application and issuance data from the City’s Office of Buildings.  Atlanta Reimagined 
 
27 
 • Public safety camera data at the Atlanta Police Dep artment’s video integration center. 
• Park and Recreation Center attendance data. 
• Airport passenger and cargo volumes. 
Data collected and aggregated through the Smart Cit y Command Center can be combined with 
existing city data to improve upon a variety of ser vices. Some core examples include: 
• Scheduling of trash collection trucks during off-pe ak hours to reduce road congestion. 
• Improved routing of emergency response vehicles to reduce arrival times. 
• Use of sensor data to predict potential accident an d crime hot spots based on weather 
conditions, population movement and time of day. 
• Use of sensor data to detect critical water main le aks and breaks. 
• Use of sensor data to detect road abnormalities suc h as potholes. 
• Optimal scheduling of preventative maintenance to r oads, lights and other traffic 
infrastructure. 
• Location, mode and frequency of future public trans port investments. 
• Coordinated mitigation and remediation of weather e vents. 
All data collected by the SCCC will be aggregated o n to an existing open data platform, where it 
will be shared with both partners and the public. A dditionally, if selected, the City is committed 
to aggregating the data listed above on to this plat form as well. To do this, the City will work to 
implement an open data policy modeled after the bes t practice 31 point framework put forth 
by the Sunlight Foundation. 
Terms of Use would include disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability as needed, but 
will also include: no cost or registration requirem ent, no restriction on use, and no license 
restrictions. All open data will be available as pu blic domain information. No attribution will be 
required, but citation will be recommended as a bes t practice. The City will endeavor to sign 
MOU’s with all relevant stakeholders to ensure that  this policy framework will guide the overall 
data integration process. 
10 – Approach for using existing standards, archite ctures and 
certification processes 
To ensure maximum usage of systems and infrastructu re, Atlanta will make the new system 
environment completely compatible with current and future ITS Architecture standards and all 
other applicable technical and security standards.  
As devices, functions, and configurations are ident ified, Atlanta will work with the appropriate 
stakeholders to ensure that all applicable federal,  state, and local standards are maintained. 
Atlanta will cooperate with standards developers by  exposing all data collected through the 
Smart City Command Center for analysis and testing,  as well as by providing any additional 
input requested by standards developers. In this wa y, Atlanta can truly become a living lab for 
the testing of new Smart City standards and technol ogy.  Atlanta Reimagined 
 
28 
 11 – Goals and objectives 
Vision goals 
Progress against achieving our overall vision will be measured by the following metrics: 
• Overall income equality (GINI index) 
• Median income 
• Employment rate 
• Youth reading levels and graduation rates  
• Poverty rates 
• The % of lowest quartile income residents who are a ble to move out of the lowest quartile 
These longer-term objectives all have existing meas urement methodologies and baselines 
established. We will continue to track their progre ss, and would expect to see improvement in 
each over the demonstration period. 
Outcome Goals 
More immediately, we will measure progress against the vision by tracking outcome-focused 
metrics in four key areas: 
Safety 
• Reduction in pedestrian and vehicle accidents along  smart corridors 
• Reduction in crime in defined areas around CTC node s  
Mobility 
• Decreased average commute times 
• Increased traffic flow at key bottleneck areas 
• Increased ridership of public transit 
• Increased % of public transit run on time  
Economic Vitality 
• Growth in commercial activity in defined areas arou nd CTC nodes 
• Number of startups leveraging CTC and Smart City Da ta Center resources 
• Increase in businesses founded in or relocating to Atlanta 
Sustainability: 
• Decreased number of vehicles on road during 24 hour  vehicle counts 
• Decreased emissions, as measured by PPM of industri al contaminants 
• Increased use of alternative fuel vehicles  
• Decreased number of trucks on in-town highways 
• Increase in overall citizen satisfaction 
For the above outcomes that do not have existing me asurement systems, the City will conduct 
a baseline assessment prior to program implementati on. This may involve activities such as  Atlanta Reimagined 
 
29 
 manual vehicle counts and time studies. The same me thodologies will be employed to measure 
progress throughout the demonstration period. 
12 – Capacity to take on project 
Some of the best evidence for Atlanta’s capacity to  take on this project is the current Renew 
Atlanta infrastructure bond program. This program i nvolves managing $250M worth of 
upgrades and enhancements to the City’s infrastruct ure. The City’s ongoing successful 
management of a program with a budget much larger t han this award should demonstrate its 
ability to effectively manage this proposed program . 
Other large, capital intensive projects the City ha s recently successfully managed include the 
construction of a new international terminal at Har tsfield-Jackson Airport and the Watershed 
Management Department’s substantial upgrades to Atl anta’s underground water systems. 
The above projects not only demonstrate the city’s capacity to manage this implementation, 
but also speak to the city’s infrastructure readine ss. Atlanta is experiencing a period of 
unprecedented growth in infrastructure spending at the municipal and state levels. The current 
modernization efforts around Atlanta’s infrastructu re represent the perfect window of 
opportunity to implement Smart City solutions. 
Atlanta has a growing workforce with the specialize d knowledge and skills needed to 
implement such a bold plan. According to the Bureau  of Labor Statistics, total nonfarm 
employment for the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, G a. Metropolitan Statistical Area stood at 
2,646,000 in November 2015, up 86,500, or 3.4% over  the year. Trade, transportation, and 
utilities, a super-sector critical to the success o f this plan, had the second largest increase in 
jobs locally, increasing by 18,000 from November 20 14. Employment in this super-sector grew 
3.1% in Atlanta compared to 1.7% for the nation. Em ployment in the Construction super-sector 
grew 4.3%, slightly higher than the national averag e. 
Highlights throughout the document have demonstrate d Atlanta’s executive leadership 
commitment to improving infrastructure, mobility an d technology. Atlanta also is also seen 
nationally as a leading city in performance managem ent. Mayor Kasim Reed’s Focus on Results 
Atlanta  (FOR Atlanta) performance management team has been  cited by the National League of 
Cities, among other organizations, as a best practi ce in performance management. FOR Atlanta 
regularly collects and analyzes data on hundreds of  operational performance metrics, using 
these metrics to not only assess but also improve p erformance. FOR Atlanta also recently 
launched Atlanta’s first ever public-facing perform ance website and DataAtlanta portal.

The City of Rochester is resurgent. Historically 
one of America’s ﬁ  rst “boomtowns,” Rochester 
has more recently endured a half-century of decline, causing job-loss, reduced private sector sources of regional funding, and a high percentage of poverty-stricken ci Ɵ zens. 
Today, our city is experiencing a wave of revitalizaƟ on. Thousands of units of new 
housing have or soon will be built in the Center City, and an emerging Downtown InnovaƟ on Zone is genera Ɵ ng high quality 
jobs and investment. These combined forces have changed the fortunes of our urban core, where the focus is now on managing growth rather than stemming decline. Whether dissecƟ  ng the Midtown Plaza superblock, 
removing the sunken Inner Loop Expressway, developing intermodal transporta Ɵ on hubs, or 
aggressively building out an extensive bicycle network, the City of Rochester is commiƩ  ed to 
creaƟ ng a smart, sustainable city for the 21st 
Century.
However, our city and region faces a cri Ɵ cal 
test that will determine whether or not that 
21st Century city meets the needs of all of our residents. In spite of its abundant resources and apparent wealth, Rochester, when compared to other mid-sized ci Ɵ es, is home 
to a crippling concentra Ɵ on of urban poverty. 
Recent studies indicate that Rochester has the highest rate of child poverty, the highest rate of extreme poverty, and the second-highest rate of poverty overall in the na Ɵ on. Unless the 
rate and scale of poverty in our community is addressed, the city and region will struggle to meet its full poten Ɵ al.
Through the leadership of Mayor Lovely Warren and Governor Andrew Cuomo, in coordinaƟ on with a broad public, private, 
and non-pro ﬁ t iniƟ aƟ ve, the community has 
targeted a 50% reduc Ɵ on in poverty over the next 15 years. To that end, Rochester recognizes the unique opportunity that the Smart City Challenge provides to dedicate technological advancements in the transporta Ɵ on sector to achieve our goal of 
reducing urban poverty and improving the quality of life for all ci Ɵ zens. This will be done 
in three ways: improving safety for travelling ciƟ zens, enhancing mobility by crea Ɵ ng more 
and beƩ er travel op Ɵ ons, and advancing 
environmental sustainability by reducing energy consump Ɵ on and greenhouse gases 
(GHG). 
By invesƟ ng in the Smart City Challenge and 
leveraging private sector funds, we will be 
able to enhance long-term transporta Ɵ on 
soluƟ ons that be Ʃ er connect communi Ɵ es 
to employment centers, educa Ɵ on centers, 
health care facili Ɵ es, and services. The City 
of Rochester and its assembled consor Ɵ um 
of partners, is commiƩ  
ed to successful 
implementa Ɵ on of the Smart City Challenge. If 
awarded, the results achieved in Rochester will be replicable in ci Ɵ es across the country.
TransportaƟ  on & Poverty
Transporta Ɵ on has played a regre Ʃ able 
role in crea Ɵ ng an environment in which 
poverty can concentrate and spread. CiƟ  es 
have historically grown outward with each transporta Ɵ on innova Ɵ on as faster, more 
eﬃ  cient transporta Ɵ on services enabled 
people to live further from the historic center. This phenomenon is nothing new. However, the prolifera Ɵ on of the car, coupled with 
supporƟ ve infrastructure, land use, and 
ﬁ nancial policies, enabled this to take place on 
a massive scale beginning in the 1950s.
The impact on ci Ɵ es such as Rochester was 
two-fold. First and foremost, suburbaniza Ɵ on 
robbed ci Ɵ es of a signi ﬁ cant share of their 
middle and upper-income families, leaving Our goal is to reduce poverty by 50% in 15 years, using 
our Smart City Vision as a driving force of change. 
City of Rochester, NY | 1ROC FORWARD»»»behind a largely poor and working-class 
populace. The City of Rochester’s popula Ɵ on 
peaked in 1950 at over 330,000; today, the City’s popula Ɵ on is just over 210,000, a loss 
of more than one-third. Secondly, the rush to serve the car and compete with suburban development led ciƟ  es to make poor decisions 
or allow such decisions to be made on their behalf. These decisions included wholesale demoliƟ on of neighborhoods to accommodate 
interstates and expressways, o Ō en built 
through established African-American communi Ɵ es; widening of streets to increase 
vehicular throughput, typically at the expense of bicyclists and pedestrians; removal of streetcar and trolley lines from city streets and corridors; and demoli Ɵ on of historic buildings 
and streets in favor of parking facili Ɵ es and 
car-oriented development. 
Rochester, like many ci Ɵ es, was scarred by 
these decisions. As much of the historic 
fabric of the city was destroyed, the social networks that bound residents and businesses together were lost as well. As people le Ō  
the city, businesses followed, crea Ɵ ng a 
downward spiral of disinvestment in many neighborhoods. This also created a spa Ɵ al 
mismatch between new job opportuni Ɵ es and 
lower-income residents. As jobs migrated to the periphery, inner city residents’ ability to access them became strained; this, combined with a host of other factors, ul Ɵ mately resulted 
in chronic unemployment and poverty in city neighborhoods.Transporta Ɵ on is neither the cause of nor 
soluƟ on to poverty. However, it is undeniable 
that transporta Ɵ on is a contribu Ɵ ng factor 
and that e ﬀ orts to improve accessibility and 
mobility for all residents can signi ﬁ cantly 
improve outcomes for our city’s most disadvantaged. Take Sheila for example; she resides in a city neighborhood and works a low-wage job at a small manufacturer a short walk from home. Sheila is able to stay out of poverty in part because, although she does not own a car, most everything she needs is located within her local community. Day care, grocery, health care, and employment are all within easy reach. 
However, the employer decides to relocate the 
business to a suburban site ten miles away. The new locaƟ on is too far to walk or bike and is 
poorly served by transit. Sheila cannot a ﬀ ord a 
car on her salary and must rely on the current transit service. Because bus service is not as frequent in this low-density suburban area, she must now add 90 minutes to her daily commute each way. Her day care provider can no longer accommodate her child’s schedule and so a new provider is found, adding another 30 minutes to the commute. Sheila’s health and that of her child su ﬀ er as doctor visits 
must be curtailed. She o Ō en shows up late to 
work due to the ﬂ  uctuaƟ ons in travel Ɵ mes 
caused by tra ﬃ  c condiƟ ons, weather, and 
other events out of her control. This prompts her employer to terminate her posiƟ  on. With 
no comparable employment opportuni Ɵ es in

now living in poverty.
This is a very common scenario playing out 
in Rochester and in ci Ɵ es naƟ onwide. Unless 
addressed, it threatens our na Ɵ on’s future 
economic compe Ɵ Ɵ veness. Yet it presents a 
unique opportunity to use the resources of the Smart City Challenge to make our ci Ɵ es’ future 
transporta Ɵ on system work for all residents. 
This is Rochester’s challenge - one that we are well prepared to address.
Mayor Warren has taken steps to drive change, 
launching the Mayor’s O ﬃ  ce of Innova Ɵ on 
and Strategic Ini Ɵ aƟ ves, and leading the 
Rochester-Monroe An Ɵ -Poverty Ini Ɵ aƟ ve 
(RMAPI). Together with key agency partners, the City is preparing new program and policy recommenda Ɵ ons to impact poverty, including 
issues of transporta Ɵ on. The program has 
state level support from the oﬃ   ce of Governor 
Cuomo and direct communica Ɵ ons with a task 
force comprised of high level New York State oﬃ  cials. Governor Cuomo is already poin Ɵ ng 
to the eﬀ ort as an example for other states to 
follow.RMAPI and the City recently approved an anƟ -poverty target area encompassing three 
conƟ  guous neighborhoods. This target area 
will be where we will test and measure the impact of new an Ɵ -poverty strategies. The 
area was selected through a data driven process that iden Ɵ ﬁ ed an area with good 
exisƟ ng resources that is impacted by 
socioeconomic issues. The O ﬃ  ce of Innova Ɵ on 
will help design programs with data sharing best pracƟ  ces, and ensure capabili Ɵ es to track 
long term individual outcomes. The O ﬃ  ce will 
also be retained to evaluate program impact, and help make modi ﬁ caƟ ons when necessary. 
Given the a Ʃ enƟ 
on, investment, data sharing, 
and evalua Ɵ on about to occur within this 
area, it is an ideal loca Ɵ on to also pilot new 
transporta Ɵ on technologies designed to 
posiƟ vely impact people in poverty.

City of Rochester, NY | 3ROC FORWARD»»»Our Proposed Elements
The City of Rochester and its partners intend to 
develop a 21st Century transporta Ɵ on system 
that addresses our mobility and safety needs while growing the local and regional economy and oﬀ ering a stairway out of poverty. A 
primary focus will be on enhancing transit accessibility for our residents, 73% of whom are underserved by public transporta Ɵ on. 
We must face our challenges directly, creaƟ ng a path to quality jobs for our ci Ɵ zens 
while building a more robust and smart transporta Ɵ on system. This is consistent with 
our stated vision and with the USDOT Ladders of Opportunity Ini Ɵ aƟ ve promoted under 
Secretary Foxx’s leadership. By inves Ɵ ng in 
Rochester’s Smart City vision and leveraging private sector funding, we will create an enhanced transporta Ɵ on network that be Ʃ er 
connects our residents to employment, educaƟ on, health care, and other services. 
Our goal is to accelerate ongoing e ﬀ orts to re-
establish Rochester as a global innova Ɵ on hub. 
Through this program, we can create up to 10,000 high quality jobs in Rochester by 2020 and rebuild our manufacturing base in the process. The City and region are determined to work with our partners in the public and private sectors to have Connected Shared Automated Vehicles (CSAV) built in Rochester and the USA. We are engaged in preliminary discussions with EasyMile, one of our key partners in this endeavor, regarding this manufacturing facility. 
The USDOT Smart City Challenge has shone 
a light on innova Ɵ ve opera Ɵ onal strategies 
and technologies such as connected vehicles (CV) and automated vehicles (AV), o ﬀ ering 
new hope for addressing the complex transporta Ɵ on challenges we face as a 
naƟ on and nourishing hopes for con Ɵ nued 
economic prosperity. It’s clear that we cannot rely on past solu Ɵ ons to work in today’s 
environment. Ci Ɵ es like Rochester constantly 
face the dilemma of doing more with less. The growing frustra Ɵ on of travelers, combined 
with worsening infrastructure performance, demand that new and innova Ɵ ve strategies be 
developed. The applica Ɵ on of CSAV shu Ʃ les 
for the ﬁ  rst and last mile o ﬀ ers the poten Ɵ al for signi ﬁ cant performance improvements 
at much lower costs and in much faster Ɵ meframes than previously possible. These 
soluƟ ons are scalable and synergize with 
our City’s investments in mul Ɵ -modal 
transporta Ɵ on improvements to meet the 
needs of our residents, now and in the future. 
The City of Rochester has assembled an 
impressive consor Ɵ um of local, regional, and 
state agencies and organiza Ɵ ons, 
 insƟ tuƟ ons 
of higher learning, and industry partners who are commiƩ  ed to the success of Rochester’s 
vision for the Smart City Challenge and addressing an Ɵ -poverty iniƟ  aƟ ves. Highlights 
of the primary proposed elements are listed below:
Urban Automa Ɵ on – partnership 
between the City, EasyMile, Kodak, and the Rochester Genesee Regional Transporta Ɵ on Authority 
(RGRTA) to deploy automated 
transit shu Ʃ les on the internal street network 
of Eastman Business Park (EBP), a 1,200-acre private technology campus in the City of Rochester. This will solve ﬁ rst/last-mile 
issues with transit accessibility, demonstrate the eﬀ ecƟ veness of automated transit, 
and posiƟ on EBP and Rochester for future 
economic growth. Upon successful tes Ɵ ng 
at EBP , it is an Ɵ cipated that deployment 
would transi Ɵ on to public streets in the City 
of Rochester, with early deployment focused on the an Ɵ -poverty target area and/or the 
Downtown Innova Ɵ on Zone. The City will work 
with New York State to enact legisla Ɵ on that 
facilitates automated vehicle deployment iniƟ ally in Rochester and then expanding 
statewide. 
Intelligent, Sensor-Based Infrastructure – partnership between the City and GE to deploy GE’s Current technology via the City’s extensive street ligh Ɵ ng 
system. This technology uses 
intelligent LED light ﬁ xtures ou ƞ iƩ ed with 
sensors, transmiƩ  ers, and microprocessors 
to create a comprehensive data grid oﬀ  ering 
unparalleled possibili Ɵ es for a variety of 
considera Ɵ ons, such as tra ﬃ  c opƟ mizaƟ on, 
parking management, asset oversight, and environmental awareness.
City of Rochester, NY | 4ROC FORWARD»»»Urban Analy Ɵ cs – partnership 
between IBM, RIT, and the City 
to harness the power of Big Data and RIT’s intellectual capacity to 
address a wide variety of municipal 
needs, such as performance measurement, service delivery op Ɵ mizaƟ on, and public 
informaƟ on sharing.
User-Focused Mobility Services and Choices  – partnership between 
Xerox, RGRTA, shared mobility service providers, and the City to develop a leading edge applica Ɵ on 
for real-Ɵ  me transporta Ɵ on informa Ɵ on to 
enable be Ʃ er decision-making with respect 
to travel op Ɵ ons and integrated payment for 
those opƟ ons. This will advance the “Mobility 
on Demand” concept and facilitate more of our residents to choose car-free or car-light lifestyles. Interoperable, mobile fare payment combining a wide variety of travel op Ɵ ons 
(transit, rideshare, carshare, bikeshare, taxi, parking, etc.) is the goal and equitable access for un-banked residents without access to credit is a primary considera Ɵ on.
Urban Delivery & Logis Ɵ cs – 
partnership between Verdant Global and the City to establish a highly-e ﬃ  cient, automated 
AgriFactory at an exis Ɵ ng vacant 
warehouse in the City of Rochester. The Verdant AgriFactory will demonstrate a leap beyond tradi Ɵ onal greenhouse produc Ɵ on, 
yielding signi ﬁ cantly more fresh healthy 
produce than previously thought possible while also repurposing exis Ɵ ng vacant 
warehouse space that is easily accessible to urban popula Ɵ ons. This technological 
advancement has the poten Ɵ al to signi ﬁ cantly 
reduce emissions by elimina Ɵ ng ineﬃ  cient 
long-range transport of produce. Its fully automated system lends itself to local distribuƟ on via connected and/or automated 
vehicles, just-in- Ɵ me delivery techniques, and 
use of analy Ɵ cs to minimize con ﬂ icts between 
delivery and tra ﬃ  c needs on city streets.
Implementa Ɵ on of Rochester’s vision for a 
Smart City will enable the USA to demonstrate global leadership in these emerging technologies, clearing the way for safer, more mobile, and sustainable ci Ɵ es. Furthermore, successful implementa Ɵ on will help Rochester, 
and ciƟ es naƟ on
wide, a Ʃ ack urban poverty 
and improve the quality of life for those living in poverty. Rochester is a smaller city, enabling us to be more nimble and allowing the federal dollars to fund more innova Ɵ ve soluƟ ons. 
Our collabora Ɵ ve, coopera Ɵ ve environment 
minimizes risk, providing assurance that our city and region is focused on delivering a Smart City focused on the future. The consorƟ um that will guide this investment 
is wide-reaching, demonstra Ɵ ng that our 
community is suppor Ɵ ve of and invested in 
implemen Ɵ ng the Smart City Challenge.
Program Management
Implementa Ɵ on of a comprehensive 
governance framework is cri Ɵ cal to ensuring 
interagency collabora Ɵ on and transparent 
accountability throughout the life of the Smart City Challenge. The City of Rochester will serve as the primary Point of Contact with USDOT for all aspects of the Smart City Challenge. To assist City sta ﬀ  and leadership 
with management responsibili Ɵ es, Stantec 
will provide project management services and technical exper Ɵ se, working closely with 
all project partners to ensure successful implementa Ɵ on of the City’s vision. It is 
anƟ cipated that a Governing Board, chaired 
by the Mayor and consis Ɵ ng of high-
ranking o ﬃ  cials from the many public and 
City of Rochester, NY | 5ROC FORWARD»»»private sector partners, will provide high-

Rochester is an ideal candidate for the Smart City Challenge. According to the 2010 Census, Rochester has a popula Ɵ on of 210,565 
represenƟ ng a signi ﬁ cant share of the overall 
populaƟ on (29%) living within the urbanized 
area. The 35.78 square miles of land that comprise the City exhibit a density of 5,884.9 persons per square mile. Rochester is the third-largest city in New York State. It is the seat of Monroe County, which had a 2010 populaƟ on of 744,344. The city is at the center 
of a larger six-county metropolitan area which had a popula Ɵ on of 1,079,671 in 2010. 
Rochester is also a very diverse place. 41.7% of the popula Ɵ on is African American, 37.6% 
is White, 16.4% is Hispanic or La Ɵ no, 3.1% 
is Asian and 1.2% is American Indian, Alaska NaƟ ve or NaƟ ve Hawaiian. Further, recent 
Census data indicates that Rochester has the highest rate of child poverty (50.1%), the highest rate of extreme poverty, and the second-highest rate of poverty overall in the naƟ on. With a diverse popula Ɵ on 
and residents facing economic hardships, successful implementa Ɵ on of Smart City 
elements in Rochester will have broad applicability in ci Ɵ es naƟ onwide.

ExisƟ ng TransportaƟ  on 
System
Fixed route bus transit service in the City of Rochester and broader region is provided by the Rochester Genesee Regional Transporta Ɵ on Authority’s Regional Transit 
Service (RTS). RTS currently operates more than 40 routes serving the city and neighboring suburbs. More than 18 million riders uƟ  lized RTS on an annual basis.
Conducive Environment
Rochester is one of America’s most crea Ɵ ve 
communi Ɵ es. We rank among the top 
communi Ɵ es for patents issued per capita as 
well as the percentage of workers in crea Ɵ ve 
industries. The talent pool and our collec Ɵ ve 
capabiliƟ es are well-regarded. In summer 
2015, Rochester was named the home for the new American Ins Ɵ tute for Manufacturing 
Integrated Photonics, a Na Ɵ onal Network 
for Manufacturing Innova Ɵ on (NNMI) 
insƟ tute. It is no surprise that our City is 
well-posiƟ oned to take a lead role among US ciƟ es to demonstrate and deploy advanced 
transporta Ɵ on technologies. 
Leadership Con Ɵ nuity
The City of Rochester is a Strong Mayor-Council government system. In this system, the Mayor possesses wide-ranging administra Ɵ ve 
control over government func Ɵ ons. Mayor 
Lovely A. Warren is in the third year of her ﬁ  rst 
term as Mayor and has already announced her intenƟ on to seek re-elec Ɵ on to a second term. 
The primary sta ﬀ  members are long-term 
municipal employees who possess signi ﬁ cant 
experience with federal projects and programs. At the outset of the program, a succession plan will be developed to ensure con Ɵ nuity should 
leadership or sta ﬀ -level changes take place.
The project will be managed by the City’s Bureau of Architecture & Engineering and overseen by the consultant team at Stantec, a global ﬁ rm with recognized special Ɵ es in 
advanced transporta Ɵ on technology. Stantec’s 
involvement will also ensure con Ɵ nuity 
and conƟ nued focus on successful program 
delivery. 
Sharing Economy
Rochester is home to a strong tradi Ɵ on of 
grassroots community development and alternaƟ ve thinking. The City is currently 
working to support the sharing economy and 
City of Rochester, NY | 7ROC FORWARD»»»alternaƟ ve ownership structures designed 
to develop a more economically inclusive 
community. In the last few years several e ﬀ orts 
have popped up in these areas: 
Market Driven Community Coopera Ɵ ves 
Since 2014, the Mayor’s O ﬃ  ce of Innova Ɵ on 
has been inves Ɵ gaƟ ng the poten Ɵ al for 
economic development strategies centered around worker-owned coopera Ɵ ve businesses. 
These businesses are designed to create entry level employment opportuni Ɵ es in some of 
Rochester’s most distressed neighborhoods.
Democracy Collabora Ɵ ve, a naƟ onal leader in 
community wealth building and worker-owned 
cooperaƟ ve development, recently completed 
a study looking into the feasibility of this strategy in Rochester. Democracy Collabora Ɵ ve 
remains involved with the Evergreen CooperaƟ ves, a successful model in Cleveland, 
Ohio that links new worker-owned businesses to the supply chain needs of local anchor insƟ tuƟ ons like universi Ɵ es and hospitals. 
The study iden Ɵ ﬁ ed signi ﬁ cant local 
anchor interest and six speci ﬁ c business 
opportuni Ɵ es based on market research. 
Democracy Collabora Ɵ ve is recommending 
forming a non-pro ﬁ t holding company to 
provide administra Ɵ ve and human resources 
support to subsidiary for-pro ﬁ t worker-owned 
businesses. The non-pro ﬁ t will also manage a 
revolving loan pool and business development services to help launch new worker-owned businesses. The Mayor and City Council are highly excited about the poten Ɵ al for this 
project, and are funding the next phase of the project to ensure businesses will be operaƟ onal in early 2017. 
Kiva Rochester Chapter - Though Rochester 
has a robust small-business community, many entrepreneurs and would-be business owners face insurmountable ﬁ nancial 
barriers when trying to launch or expand their businesses due to restric Ɵ ve lending 
policies and assessments of risk. Kiva is an internaƟ onal crowdfunding micro ﬁ nance 
insƟ tuƟ on that provides 0% interest loans to 
low-income and underserved entrepreneurs and small businesses. Funding for the loans is secured through internet crowdfunding as well as matching funds from community organizaƟ ons. The loans are issued to quali ﬁ ed 
borrowers following a process that evaluates and establishes creditworthiness. Borrowers undergo an assessment of creditworthiness through a process of social underwri Ɵ ng, 
in which char
acter and strength of support 
networks - as opposed to exclusionary criteria such as FICO scores, collateral, and cash ﬂ ow 
- are used as the best indicators of success. Borrowers pay back the loans to Kiva, who then reissues the funds to other quali ﬁ ed 
borrowers. 
The City is currently working with the 
Rochester Area Community Founda Ɵ on and 
local banks to establish a Rochester Kiva chapter with a $100,000 revolving loan pool that matches internet donors. The program will be launched in summer 2016 with a key Kiva staﬀ  person working with neighborhood 
based organiza Ɵ ons in one of Rochester’s 
underserved neighborhoods. 
RocShare - RocShare is a new organiza Ɵ on, 
founded in 2014, commi Ʃ ed to promo Ɵ ng 
the sharing economy in Rochester. RocShare 
has been inventorying and mapping sharing economy resources. They annually hold Sharefest, a conference showcasing local sharing economy e ﬀ orts, and the FreeMarket, 
an event where donated items are available for new owners. Finally, RocShare has been working to provide policy proposals for how the City might be Ʃ er support the sharing 
economy and associated e ﬀ orts.
Open, Accessible Data
The City is increasing the amount of open data it makes available to the public. In 2012, the City hired its ﬁ rst city-wide GIS coordinator in 
the Department of Informa Ɵ on Technology. 
In 2013, the City launched its ﬁ rst open data 
portal - an interac Ɵ ve mapping interface 
which allows neighborhood groups and ciƟ zens to explore their communi Ɵ es and 
look at data points from crime to property values to compiled census demographics. The data is also available for download for more intensive analysis and comparison. The City looks forward to working with its partners, speciﬁ  cally IBM and RIT, to increase open 
format data sharing with the public.

BEYOND TRAFFIC: 
THE SMART CITY CHALLENGE THE SMART CITY CHALLENGE 
City of Rochester, NY | 9ROC FORWARD»»»OUR APPROACH
Urban AutomaƟ  on
The transporta Ɵ on system of 
the 21st Century Smart City will 
be safe, accessible, equitable, and sustainable. Automated transporta Ɵ on services represent 
the next era of mobility innova Ɵ on. Automated 
transit in par Ɵ cular oﬀ ers an exciƟ  ng 
opportunity to augment and expand exis Ɵ ng 
public transporta Ɵ on services in order to 
beƩ er serve the mobility needs of our city’s 
residents and businesses. Automated transit provides a new soluƟ  on to the ﬁ rst-mile/last-
mile accessibility challenge of exis Ɵ ng ﬁ xed 
route transit services. In partnership with EasyMile and Kodak, we propose to conduct ﬁ eld tesƟ ng and deployment of automated 
transit shu Ʃ les at the 1,200-acre Eastman 
Business Park (EBP) campus, located primarily within the City of Rochester. 
EBP , formerly Kodak Park, is one of the na Ɵ on’s 
largest urban technology campuses. EBP is 
enƟ rely privately-owned and operated, with its 
own streets, railroad, wastewater treatment, ﬁ re protec Ɵ on, and power genera Ɵ on. Over 
6,000 workers are currently employed at EBP . With 2.5M square feet of space and over 300 acres of developable land, there will be signi ﬁ cant growth in the years ahead. 
As such, EBP is a perfect real-world tes Ɵ ng 
and deployment site for automated transit shuƩ les. There are currently six Regional 
Transit Service (RTS) routes which provide access to EBP . However, because public buses do not operate on the campus, it can be challenging for workers to get between the bus stop and their workplace. Automated transit can solve this problem, leading to a greater share of trips being taken by transit.
It is anƟ cipated that deployment at EBP will 
grow over Ɵ me, serving as a dis Ɵ nguishing 
feature that a Ʃ racts jobs and investment 
to this urban campus. Rochester will also 
aggressively pursue opportuni Ɵ es for 
manufacturing and assembly of these automated transit vehicles, poten Ɵ ally creaƟ ng large numbers of high quality jobs in our community. Upon successful tes Ɵ ng at EBP , it is 
anƟ cipated that deployment would transi Ɵ on 
to public streets in the City of Rochester, with early deployment focused on the an Ɵ -poverty 
target area and/or the Downtown Innova Ɵ on 
Zone. The City will work with New York State to enact legisla Ɵ on that facilitates automated 
v
ehicle deployment ini Ɵ ally in Rochester and 
then expanding statewide.
Connected Shared Automated Vehicle (CSAV) Shu Ʃ les
Over the past few years there has been signiﬁ cant research and demonstra Ɵ on of 
various AV products. Companies such as Google and automobile manufacturers have been tesƟ ng their AVs with impressive results 
for a number of Ready-to-Market (RTM) products such as CSAV shu Ʃ les. More work 
is needed to re ﬁ ne the technology, but the 
pace of progress has accelerated. There is growing public awareness that the use of AVs by the public is a ma Ʃ er of when and not if. 
In fact, starƟ  ng in 2016 many demonstra Ɵ on 
projects will begin to gradually transi Ɵ on 
to public streets across the globe. We want Rochester to take a lead role. Large companies and start-ups are inves Ɵ ng billions of dollars 
in the research and development of AV technologies in combina Ɵ on with innova Ɵ ve 
business models such as Uber and on-demand transit. Over Ɵ  me, this will result in a massive 
transforma Ɵ on of the mobility landscape with 
signiﬁ cant societal implica Ɵ ons. Safety is the 
single most important bene ﬁ t associated with 
AVs given that over 90% of tra ﬃ  c incidents are 
caused by human error. 
City of Rochester, NY | 10ROC FORWARD»»»A natural extension of AV technology is into 
the sphere of public transporta Ɵ on. More 
speciﬁ  cally, the applica Ɵ on of electric CSAV 
shuƩ les for complemen Ɵ ng and integra Ɵ ng 
with tradi Ɵ onal modes of transit. This has 
been in the demonstra Ɵ on phase in Europe 
for the CityMobil2 ini Ɵ aƟ ve (see image below) 
during the past ﬁ ve years and holds great 
promise in addressing the challenges faced by transit operators. Today these agencies face growing public frustra Ɵ on with inadequate 
parking at major transit centers and lack of reliable connec Ɵ ons, which nega Ɵ vely impact 
ridership targets. 
 
CSAV shu Ʃ les can also address mobility 
requirements in urban se ƫ  ngs such as college 
campuses and large residen Ɵ al developments. 
For example, city residents may face daily challenges ﬁ nding parking spaces for inter-
city trips and/or access to and from transit staƟ ons. CSAV shu Ʃ les can address these 
challenges in a very e ﬃ  cient, reliable, safe, 
and friendly manner. They can be especially eﬀ ecƟ ve in areas not served by tradi Ɵ onal 
bus or mass transit and can help connect those centers with transporta Ɵ on hubs. 
Furthermore, CSAV shu Ʃ les can serve as 
new modes of transit with dynamic rou Ɵ ng 
- in essence combining the best features of ridesharing services with tradi Ɵ onal 
ﬁ xed-route opera Ɵ ons. CSAV will allow 
impoverished ci Ɵ zens get to their jobs. 
Depending on speci ﬁ c CSAV shu Ʃ le 
implementa Ɵ on scenarios (urban centers or ﬁ rst/last-mile) some infrastructure prepara Ɵ on 
may be required. For example, CSAV shu Ʃ les 
can share space with bicycles in a downtown ar
ea with dedicated curb-side bicycle lanes. 
In other cases, such as connec Ɵ ng major 
transit hubs to parking areas, Hard Shoulder Running (HSR) strategies can be deployed to accommodate higher speed CSAV shu Ʃ les. 
The Rochester se ƫ  ng and number of college 
campuses and business parks presents mulƟ ple opportuni Ɵ es for synergis Ɵ c 
applicaƟ on of CSAV shu Ʃ les during peak hours. 
Keys to success of CSAV shu Ʃ les are:
 »Technology tes Ɵ ng and prototype 
development (ongoing)
 »Appropriate regulatory frameworks for operaƟ ons under reduced speeds for 
safe and e ﬃ  cient early deployment (in 
development)
 »IdenƟ ﬁ caƟ on of sites with demonstrated 
transit need, demand, and infrastructure integraƟ on
 »OperaƟ onal exper Ɵ se to ensure e ﬃ  cient 
and reliable services
 »Improved “backbone transit” such as BRT, connecƟ  on buses, or shu Ʃ le buses to 
improve travel Ɵ me and reliability
CSAV shu Ʃ les can operate at low speeds 
(25mph) and can be integrated with dedicated bicycle lanes that are increasing in Rochester and ciƟ es across North America. This 
approach will help to accelerate CSAV shu Ʃ le 
adopƟ on, enhance transit system ridership, 
and contribute to modal shi Ō  and the overall 
opƟ mizaƟ on of our transporta Ɵ on network in 
Rochester. 
Complemen Ɵ ng Mass Transit
The CityMobil2 Ini Ɵ aƟ ve 
City of Rochester, NY | 11ROC FORWARD»»»Connected Vehicles
Rochester is an older, fully built-
out city with minimal opportunity to physically grow. In fact, the City has aggressively pursued a 
program of “right-sizing” streets to be Ʃ er 
meet the needs of today’s popula Ɵ on. In the 
past, the primary focus of street design was on wider roads and faster moving car tra ﬃ  c. 
Today the goal is to accommodate cars while maximizing space for other users, namely bicyclists, pedestrians, and transit users. To conƟ  nue this approach in the face of rising 
demand now and in the future, it is cri Ɵ cal 
to maximize the e ﬃ  ciency of the exis Ɵ ng 
transporta Ɵ on system. 
Connected vehicle technology provides previously unimaginable opportuni Ɵ es 
to beƩ er manage the system by greatly 
enhancing tra ﬃ  c safety, monitoring and 
responding to tra ﬃ  c condiƟ ons in real- Ɵ me, 
opƟ mizing emergency response and public 
transporta Ɵ on services, among many other 
bene ﬁ ts. Connected vehicle technology will 
allow ciƟ es to meet demand, improve service, 
and reduce costs. To that end, the City of Rochester proposes to partner with GE to deploy their Current® technology on the City street system.
Current takes advantage of the exis Ɵ ng street 
lighƟ ng system to deploy a network of sensors, 
transmiƩ  ers, and microprocessors that can 
communicate with vehicles. This technological 
advancement oﬀ  ers a myriad of possibili Ɵ es, 
such as advising drivers of unexpected hazards or upcoming tra ﬃ  c conges Ɵ on and sugges Ɵ ng 
alternate routes, or warning a wrong-way driver entering the expressway system while simultaneously no Ɵ fying authori Ɵ es and the 
traveling public.
The City will also partner with Mobileye 
to deploy their Shield+ collision avoidance technology on both the RTS bus ﬂ eet as well 
as on the City’s ﬂ eet of nearly 500 public 
works vehicles. This will greatly enhance safety for bicyclists and pedestrians on city streets while providing be Ʃ er travel Ɵ me reliability 
and service delivery to our residents and businesses.Intelligent, Sensor-Based 
Infrastructure
A Smart City is able to collect 
and analyze data to inform the public, measure performance, and opƟ mize investment 
decision-making. In the absence of a robust network of sensors, 
collecƟ ng reliable data and providing real- Ɵ me 
informaƟ on is a signi ﬁ cant challenge. Through 
our proposed partnership with GE, sensors will be ubiquitous throughout the city, enabling City government to collect a wide range of data, including mul Ɵ -modal tra ﬃ  c volumes 
and speeds, pavement condi Ɵ on, weather 
informaƟ on, ambient air quality data, parking 
availability, and motor vehicle crashes. The City will work in partnership with RIT and IBM to determine how best to integrate this new data collecƟ on capability with exis Ɵ ng data in order 
to improve customer service, manage costs, and improve government accountability.
Like many other ciƟ  es across USA, Rochester’s 
roadway infrastructures, including pavements, 
bridges, and signs, are deteriora Ɵ ng rapidly 
due to material aging, improper usage, harsh environments, and natural and man-made damages. With the advancement of sensor technologies, it becomes feasible to collect the large-scale, in- ﬁ eld, and detailed infrastructure 
data, such as 3D pavement surface data, using high-performance cameras, lasers, LiDARs, and InerƟ al Naviga Ɵ on System (INS). This allows 
for beƩ er insight and understanding of large-
scale in- ﬁ eld infrastructure behavior. We will 
build a framework for the sensor-based and spaƟ ally-enabled next genera Ɵ on intelligent, 
sustainable infrastructure management system, including the key components of data acquisiƟ on, automa Ɵ c informa Ɵ on extracƟ  on, 
data integra Ɵ on, and intelligent infrastructure 
management with assistance from our partners, IBM and GE.
City of Rochester, NY | 12ROC FORWARD»»»Urban Analy Ɵ cs
A wealth of new data will be 
generated through the many iniƟ aƟ ves of our Smart City vision, 
complemen Ɵ ng a growing supply 
of data that is already available. Our industry partners at IBM are 
recognized global leaders in analy Ɵ cs, with 
unmatched experƟ  se in working with agencies 
and organiza Ɵ ons around the world to solve 
problems using the power of informa Ɵ on. IBM 
will work in tandem with an interdepartmental research team at RIT, in conjuncƟ  on with 
the City and non-pro ﬁ t community partners 
such as Reconnect Rochester and the Center for Disability Rights, to develop informa Ɵ on 
sharing pla ƞ orms, smart mobile applica Ɵ ons, 
and other techniques to address a wide variety of issues ranging from Transporta Ɵ on Demand 
Management in the downtown area to city-wide universal access and design and goods movement.
User-focused Mobility 
Services and Choices
A criƟ  cal component in enhancing 
mobility for travelers is to give 
them beƩ er informa Ɵ on that can 
be used to make smart decisions about their trip. Through our partnership with Xerox and other 
partners, the City will develop a leading edge applica Ɵ on for real- Ɵ me transporta Ɵ on 
informaƟ on to enable be Ʃ er decision-making 
with respect to travel op Ɵ ons and integrated 
payment for those op Ɵ ons, advancing the 
“Mobility on Demand” concept and facilita Ɵ ng 
more of our residents to choose car-free or car-light lifestyles. Interoperable, mobile fare payment combining a wide variety of travel opƟ ons (transit, rideshare, carshare, bikeshare, 
taxi, parking, etc.) is the goal and equitable access for un-banked residents without access to credit is a primary considera Ɵ on. 
Parking management is another important factor for the City. Parking can impact congesƟ on, aﬀ ect safety, and impede 
access. Determining occupancy is the key to understanding demand and se ƫ  ng the appropriate metered parking prices. When hourly parking meter prices don’t keep up with demand, the search for parking becomes painful. That search creates conges Ɵ on and 
dangerous condi Ɵ ons as frustrated motorists 
circle for parking. While there’s a municipal impact on revenue, the real weight of these policy decisions rests squarely on the backs of customers, people like motorists, merchants, bicyclists, pedestrians, and other stakeholders.
Xerox’s Merge® pla ƞ orm will provide a means 
of managing parking opera Ɵ ons with a central 
management solu Ɵ on. Merge® fully integrates 
and provides analy Ɵ cs on all aspects of 
metered and oﬀ  -street programs. The system 
integrates hardware and soŌ  ware to provide 
real-Ɵ  me informa Ɵ on about coin collec Ɵ ons, 
meter maintenance, enforcement, and 
occupancy by applying real- Ɵ me data to solve 
parking and mobility issues.
Our goal is to be inclusive with all ci Ɵ zens. 
Therefore, we have engaged representa Ɵ ves 
of the Center for Disability Rights, Inc. (CDR), a 
not-for-pro ﬁ t, community-based advocacy and 
service organiza Ɵ on for people with all types 
of disabili Ɵ es, including over 10,000 disabled 
adults aged 20-64 living in poverty. CDR has already provided a number of important insights regarding our transporta Ɵ on system of 
today and tomorrow, including:
»Univ
ersal design should be used 
throughout any transporta Ɵ on plan to 
ensure we don’t have any segregated transporta Ɵ on for people with disabili Ɵ es.
»For communica Ɵ on, emphasis should 
be put on text communica Ɵ on either via 
a texƟ ng or a web-based pla ƞ orm, like 
TwiƩ er. This will help to target the younger 
populaƟ on as well as the Deaf Community. 
»All web-based site or applica Ɵ ons should 
be screen-reader friendly to ensure the Blind popula Ɵ on has access to the 
informaƟ on.
»A mobile applica Ɵ on that iden Ɵ ﬁ es the 
accessible entrance on buildings is needed to help with transporta Ɵ on coordina Ɵ on. 
This would allow a person to choose to get oﬀ  at a bus stop closest to that entrance or 
plan another accessible path of travel. 
City of Rochester, NY | 13ROC FORWARD»»»Urban Delivery and 
LogisƟ cs
The Rochester team has included 
Verdant Global to help transform Rochester into a truly sustainable Smart City. Their patented 
technology enables them to produce fresh, consistent, insec Ɵ cide-free produce year 
round. Their business model uses exis Ɵ ng 
vacant structures and repurposes them to operate fully automated AgriFactories for local consump Ɵ on. The City will partner with 
Verdant Global to establish a highly-e ﬃ  cient, 
automated AgriFactory at an exis Ɵ ng vacant 
warehouse in the City of Rochester. This will eliminate many long-haul delivery trucks from our busy streets and highways and greatly reduce GHG emissions. Its fully automated system lends itself to local distribu Ɵ on via 
connected and/or automated vehicles, just-in-Ɵ me delivery techniques, and use of analy Ɵ cs 
to minimize con ﬂ icts between delivery and 
traﬃ  c needs on city streets.
It will also provide much needed purpose for vacant and abandoned buildings, thereby invigoraƟ ng distressed neighborhoods 
and proper Ɵ es. It may also lead to direct 
employment, provide passive surveillance, create a new tax base, and poten Ɵ ally 
sƟ mulate other economic and business 
acƟ vity. Through their business case speci ﬁ cs, 
the opportunity may exist to give back new sources of regional funding that can then be reinvested in the community through new community services, community centers and other social investments. We believe this can ulƟ mately lead to a reducƟ  on in poverty in the 
very neighborhoods these ini Ɵ aƟ ves occur.
Strategic Business Models 
& Partnering
The City of Rochester is a ﬁ rm 
believer in entrepreneurial 
government. This is evidenced by the establishment of the O ﬃ  ce 
of Innova Ɵ on & Strategic Ini Ɵ aƟ ves and the 
support it has received through Bloomberg Philanthropies and IBM’s Smarter Ci Ɵ es IniƟ aƟ ve to develop innova Ɵ ve soluƟ ons for 
reducing poverty in our community. The City brings this same approach to the Smart City Challenge. As detailed in Sec Ɵ on 7, the City has 
assembled a dynamic and broad consor Ɵ um 
of partners across all levels of government, academia, business, and community. These partners are commi Ʃ ed to making Rochester 
the successful Smart City that will serve as a model for using technological innova Ɵ on to 
improve safety, enhance mobility, and protect the environment while also expanding equity and aƩ acking urban poverty. Upon no Ɵ ﬁ caƟ on 
of our selec Ɵ on as a Smart City Finalist, the 
City of Rochester will work with its partners to further de ﬁ ne roles and responsibili Ɵ es, and 
terms of reference, for each func Ɵ onal body.
The City of Rochester is partnering with RIT, a comprehensive na Ɵ onal research university 
with nearly 19,000 students. RIT is a member (sub-grantee) of the Region 2 University Transporta Ɵ on Center (UTC) consor Ɵ um whose 
strategic goal is economic compe Ɵ Ɵ veness. 
This partnership will allow the City to leverage the intellectual capacity of both RIT and the UTC as a whole.
It is anƟ cipated that opportuni Ɵ es for cost-
sharing and in-kind service delivery will be 
made available. The ability to leverage the federal resources provided through the Smart City Challenge to a Ʃ ract addi Ɵ onal ﬁ nancial 
and technical assistance will help to ensure that Rochester’s Smart City vision produces a real and long-las Ɵ ng impact on Rochester, New 
York State, and the na Ɵ on as a whole.
Smart Grid, Roadway 
Electri ﬁ caƟ on, & Electric 
Vehicles
The Oﬃ   ce of Electricity Delivery 
& Energy Reliability (OE) has 
taken on a na Ɵ onal leadership 
role to modernize the na Ɵ on’s 
electricity delivery system. A 
Policy Framework for the 21st Century Grid describes four goals to be pursued to ensure that all Americans bene ﬁ t from investment 
in the NaƟ on’s electric infrastructure: be Ʃ er 
City of Rochester, NY | 14ROC FORWARD»»»alignment of economic incen Ɵ ves to boost 
development and deployment of smart-grid 
technologies; a greater focus on standards and interoperability to enable greater innova Ɵ on; 
empowerment of consumers with enhanced informaƟ on to save energy, ensure privacy, 
and shrink bills; and improve grid security and resilience. 
OE has established seven principal smart grid 
funcƟ onal characteris Ɵ cs:
 »Self-healing from power disturbance events
 »Enabling ac Ɵ ve parƟ cipaƟ on by consumers 
in demand response
 »OperaƟ ng resiliently against physical and 
cyber aƩ ack
 »Providing power quality for 21st century needs
 »Accommoda Ɵ ng all genera Ɵ on and storage 
opƟ ons
 »Enabling new products, services and markets
 »OpƟ mizing assets and opera Ɵ ng eﬃ  ciently
By focusing on Eastman Business Park as a potenƟ al private pilot campus, the ability to 
analyze each of these func Ɵ onal characteris Ɵ cs 
in a seƫ  ng that is transferrable to a public 
porƟ on of the City becomes possible.
As part of an exis Ɵ ng program, the City 
is partnering with Energe Ɵ cs and the 
Electriﬁ  caƟ on CoaliƟ on to grow the Electric 
Vehicle (EV) ecosystem in Rochester and in so doing, expand the market for EVs. EV Charging Sta Ɵ on Plans for the ﬁ ve regions 
along the I-90 Corridor (Capital District, Mohawk Valley, Central New York, Genesee Valley/Finger Lakes, and Western New York) will be implemented, spurring EV acceptance and adop Ɵ on. The outcome will be: 1) 
25 EV charging sta Ɵ 
 ons (5 in each region) 
strategically installed in cri Ɵ cal areas to enable 
greater EV use, 2) educated municipali Ɵ es 
on EV charging sta Ɵ on permi ƫ  ng and 
communi Ɵ es on EV technology, 3) 900 rebates 
for EV purchases to spur EV sales and establish more EV advocates (the new EV owners), and 4) 40 ride-n-drive events to promote EVs and allow consumers a test drive opportunity of diﬀ erent makes and models in a single 
locaƟ on.The Rochester EV Deployment Community will also foster a model EV Community in which EVs are embraced by the public and promoted by business and government. This approach moves EVs from a niche product into a dominant and ubiquitous concept. The outcomes will be: 1) 9 EV charging sta Ɵ ons in 
City of Rochester garages for public and city-owned EVs, 2) EVs for the City of Rochester as an ambassador of the technology and to showcase their opera Ɵ on, and 3) an 
extensive community engagement to inform and educate the residents and businesses throughout the City about the bene ﬁ ts of EVs. 
The Rochester EV Deployment Community will create replicable models for other New York communi Ɵ es to use for accelera Ɵ ng EV 
adopƟ on.

CiƟ zens
Our ciƟ zens are going to determine 
if any measures proposed to 
address the Smart City Challenge are indeed a success. Fortunately, we have a number of strong, ciƟ  zen 
lead organiza Ɵ ons that currently provide input 
on transporta Ɵ on related issues. Three such 
organizaƟ ons are: Rochester Cycling Alliance, 
Reconnect Rochester, and Community Design Center Rochester. Through educa Ɵ on and 
outreach, each of these groups help create a broad base of support for our exis Ɵ ng 
public transit system, shape regional policies to improve the system, and reconnect our community in ways that improve personal mobility, urban vitality, environmental sustainability, and economic development. We would look to these groups, as well as other City and ci Ɵ zen-lead organiza Ɵ ons, to 
be partners in all phases of the Smart City Challenge.
We will be reaching out to ci Ɵ zens that are not 
currently engaged through the use of the City’s 
website, television and radio, public outreach meeƟ ngs, and social media. Social media will be especially useful in broadening public awareness of the ini Ɵ aƟ ves 
that will be undertaken. We will meet people where they expect to be met in this day and age where 85% of American adults use the internet and 91% of adults have a cell phone. We want to engage a wide range of people during the process and the best way to reach an audience more inclined to use new technology is through social media. 
Architecture & Standards
Given the amount of data that will be collected from a variety of partners, a robust system of integrated funcƟ  onality supported 
by a common, shared database is a must. The City of Rochester currently employs ITS systems for transporta Ɵ on data collec Ɵ on. As 
described in the IBM Smarter Ci Ɵ es Challenge 
Report, a solu Ɵ on based system will need to 
incorporate the following:
»Person-centric applica Ɵ ons
»Mobility
»Master data management
»Content management systems
»System interfaces
»Data security
»Role-based user access
City of Rochester, NY | 16ROC FORWARD»»»»Audit-tracking and repor Ɵ ng
»Data warehousing
»OperaƟ onal repor Ɵ ng
»AnalyƟ cs and predic Ɵ ve analyƟ cs
»Document management
»Disaster recovery and performance
As an on-going task within the Smart City 
Challenge, an evalua Ɵ on will be made of 
these system components to determine if the exisƟ ng ITS system requires upda Ɵ ng. If new 
standards are needed, recommenda Ɵ ons will 
be provided to USDOT and the Connected Vehicle Reference Implementa Ɵ on (CVRIA) to 
the extent possible. 
Using the CVRIA, we will determine the roles, 
processes, data ﬂ  ows, physical components, 
and communica Ɵ on protocols necessary for 
privacy and security opera Ɵ ons using the 
SCMS prototype. We will concurrently use the Systems Engineering Tool for Intelligent Transporta Ɵ on (SET-IT) to complete the project 
architecture of diagrams and de ﬁ niƟ ons of all 
layers and func Ɵ onal components along with 
an inclusive Privacy and Security Management OperaƟ onal Concept, aligning requirements to 
necessary aspects of the CVRIA. Our program management consultant, Stantec, will iden Ɵ fy 
the needs, stakeholders, systems, and Smart City Connected Vehicle applica Ɵ ons that will 
make up our deployment program. We will enter the informa Ɵ on gathered into the SET-IT 
soŌ ware and tailor each applica Ɵ on at layer 
2 in the physical and enterprise views. We will then tailor the layer 1 and layer 0 physical diagrams as well as the layer 0 enterprise diagrams in prepara Ɵ on for presenta Ɵ on of 
the project architecture to the stakeholder review panel. We will generate the Concept of OperaƟ ons from the SET-IT so Ō ware and 
provide support and/or develop the remaining secƟ ons of the Concept of Opera Ɵ ons not 
detailed in the generated document. InformaƟ  on & 
Communica Ɵ ons Technology
In Rochester, like many other ciƟ es, our exis Ɵ ng Informa Ɵ on and 
Communica Ɵ on Technology (ICT) 
infrastructure is lacking capital investment due to our resurgence 
from the recessionary era of past decade. The Smart City Concept will allow us to re-evaluate our ICT infrastructure and build a robust, eﬃ  cient, secure and resilient ICT to lower 
our consump Ɵ on while building a redundant 
hi-bird communica Ɵ on system. Through our 
partnership with IBM and GE, we will focus on Green Networking as the way to help reduce carbon emissions by the ICT industry. The Smart City Challenge will present us with opportunity to implement our City’s green networking vision by selec Ɵ ng energy-e ﬃ  cient 
networking technologies and products, and minimize resource use whenever possible. Our ICT green networking prac Ɵ ce will include: 
implemen Ɵ ng virtualiza Ɵ on; pracƟ  cing server 
consolida Ɵ on; relying on cloud compu Ɵ ng; 
upgrading older equipment for newer, more energy-eﬃ  cient product; employing system 
management to increase e ﬃ  ciency; and 
promoƟ  ng telecommuƟ  ng. Our vision is to 
lower consump Ɵ on by 25% by 2025 and we 
will leverage mostly private sector capital investment by providing mulƟ  -year incen Ɵ ves 
in sharing cost reduc Ɵ on revenue. 
We will develop security requirements for the DSRC devices that we expect to deploy in Rochester. We will follow the Common Criteria methodology, an ISO standard, to complete an analysis of needs and develop recommenda Ɵ ons for a security standard. 
The methodology includes analyzing threats, assumpƟ ons, policies, objec Ɵ ves, and 
developing security func Ɵ onal requirements 
to miƟ gate threats and ensure con ﬁ denƟ ality, 
availability, integrity, authen Ɵ city, and non-
repudiaƟ on of transmi Ʃ ed data for ICT. We 
will compare our analysis against similar domesƟ c and interna Ɵ onal eﬀ orts to ensure a 
comprehensive assessment of security needs. Our team expects to leverage our exis Ɵ ng 
analyses and update use cases, measures, 
and requirements, with an overall system 
City of Rochester, NY | 17ROC FORWARD»»»implementa Ɵ on and applica Ɵ on deployment 
viewpoint, to develop and execute an e ﬀ ecƟ ve 
security management opera Ɵ onal strategy. 
Our partners at Stantec have extensive 
experience with the current SCMS design through their close working rela Ɵ onship 
with USDOT and its partners as they have developed the fundamental security system (SCMS) for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to infrastructure (V2I) safety systems and applica Ɵ ons. Our team will leverage the 
experƟ se in this domain to determine which 
requirements can be ful ﬁ lled based on the 
prototype SCMS and align these requirements to each SCMS func Ɵ onal component. Using 
the CVRIA, we will determine the roles, processes, data ﬂ  ows, physical components, 
and communica Ɵ ons protocols necessary for 
privacy and security opera Ɵ ons uƟ lizing the 
SCMS prototype. The team will concurrently use the SET-IT to complete project architecture of diagrams and de ﬁ niƟ ons at all layers 
and funcƟ onal components along with an 
inclusive Privacy and Security Management OperaƟ onal Concept aligning requirements to 
necessary aspects of the CVRIA. The Security Management Opera Ɵ onal Concept will 
include clear direc Ɵ on on how to approach 
ensuring physical security at the vehicle and roadside infrastructure level. Several current hardware security standards exist for ensuring against tampering of physical devices, many of which may be applicable to DSRC devices integrated or added on to vehicles. In addi Ɵ on, maintaining strong 
internal organiza Ɵ onal controls, whether 
at the technical, legal, administra Ɵ ve, or 
personnel levels should be developed and included in this Concept in order to provide as robust a security environment as possible. We have already conducted research and analysis into these areas of control, and will bring its understanding to development of the deployment plan. Tools to monitor, measure, and track security elements at all levels of the Smart City system will also be speci ﬁ ed in the 
Security Management Opera Ɵ onal Concept.Smart Land Use
The story of poverty in Rochester is one fueled by disinvestment and depopula Ɵ on. The City lost 
24% of its popula Ɵ on between 
1970 and 2010, and increased its 
poverty rate by 18% over the same Ɵ meframe. 
These ﬁ  gures are even more drama Ɵ c in high 
poverty areas, with those who are able moving away from issues of crime and disinvestment towards safety and economic opportunity. Neighborhoods like Marketview Heights have had more than 20% of their homes demolished due to vacancy and blight. According to Census LODES Origin Des Ɵ naƟ on Data, less than 5% 
of employed residents in neighborhoods like Marketview Heights hold jobs in their neighborhood, and over 50% of those employed are making long daily commutes to low skill jobs in the suburbs. Over 50% of the jobs located in the neighborhoods are held by suburban commuters. This seemingly illogical reverse commute is one of the hallmarks of the decline of these neighborhoods and the macro-economic forces driving this transforma Ɵ on. 
To address this challenge, key recommenda Ɵ ons of both the Rochester-
Monroe An Ɵ -Poverty Ini Ɵ aƟ ve (RMAPI) 
and the IBM Smarter Ci Ɵ es IniƟ aƟ ve relate 
to Smart Land Use. Speci ﬁ cally, RMAPI 
recommends the purposeful development of ‘Complete Communi Ɵ es’ while IBM 
recommends establishment of ‘Urban Villages.’ Both recommenda Ɵ ons focus on the 
creaƟ on of dense, mixed-use development 
Smart land use can create a complete community in neighborhoods like this.   
City of Rochester, NY | 18ROC FORWARD»»»nodes that feature mixed-income housing, 
retail and services, employment, health care, educaƟ onal facili Ɵ es and other services that 
are well served by an integrated, mul Ɵ -modal 
transporta Ɵ on network, minimizing the need 
for private car use. The City will work with its Smart City partners to advance these recommenda Ɵ ons.
The City of Rochester Zoning Code provides us with a strong founda Ɵ on. The Code 
recognizes, promotes, and protects a dense, walkable, and mixed-use urban character that is sustainable and cri Ɵ cal to a Smart 
City. The Code breaks away from tradi Ɵ onal 
zoning which usually a Ʃ empts to separate 
uses and o Ō en defers to vehicle-oriented site 
development. Commercial Districts and Village Center Districts provide for a dense mixture of uses such as housing, retail and other complementary uses that serve the adjacent neighborhoods and the community at large. Design standards that create, enhance, and reinforce the design rela Ɵ onships between 
buildings, sites, and streets establish an ambiance that is dense and pedestrian-oriented. The Zoning Code is evolving and will conƟ nue to respond to the need for 
sustainable redevelopment in Rochester that protects the City’s uniquely urban character.The City is in the process of upda Ɵ ng its 
Comprehensive Plan, which currently dates from 1999. A key component of the Comprehensive Plan Update is the upcoming Comprehensive Access & Mobility Plan, the transporta Ɵ on component of the Plan. The 
update process has begun and will take place concurrent with the Ɵ meline of the Smart City 
Challenge, providing a unique opportunity for the various Smart City ini Ɵ aƟ ves to inform the 
Comprehensive Plan, which will guide land use and development policy and decision-making in Rochester for the foreseeable future.

Partners
The City of Rochester, under the leadership 
of Mayor Lovely Warren and with assistance from our commi Ʃ ed consor Ɵ um of partners, 
is well structured and organized to accomplish this mission. The City has consistently taken a leadership role in transporta Ɵ on and 
believes the future economic vitality of the region depends on the ability to provide safe, reliable, and e ﬃ  cient mobility through 
the transporta Ɵ on network. It is clear that 
in the 21st Century we will not be able to be compeƟ Ɵ ve economically without smarter 
transporta Ɵ on networks that provide improved 
transit accessibility to our underserved populaƟ on. We must provide an e ﬃ  cient 
transporta Ɵ on system by using the latest 
development in Connected Shared Automated Vehicles (CSAV) applica Ɵ ons, tesƟ ng emerging 
technologies, and leveraging partnerships with the private sector. Examples are EasyMile, an interna Ɵ onal ﬁ rm that is considering 
opportuni Ɵ es to establish a manufacturing 
facility in Rochester, and other tech giants such as GE, IBM, Xerox and Kodak. 
The City of Rochester, in collabora Ɵ on with 
the public sector agencies, private sector 
businesses, ins Ɵ tuƟ ons, public advocacy, and 
non-pro ﬁ ts, is fully commi Ʃ ed to ROC Forward, 
Rochester’s Smart City vision. If selected, Rochester will successfully establish itself as the model Smart City for the na Ɵ on. 
Governance Processes
Implementa Ɵ on of a comprehensive 
governance framework is cri Ɵ cal to ensuring 
interagency collabora Ɵ on and transparent 
accountability throughout the life of the Smart City Challenge. The City of Rochester will serve as the primary Point of Contact with USDOT for all aspects of the Smart City Challenge. To assist City sta ﬀ  and leadership 
with management responsibili Ɵ es, Stantec 
will provide project management services and technical exper Ɵ se, working closely with

Partnerships
As referenced above, the City of Rochester has assembled an impressive and wide-ranging consorƟ um of public agencies, ins Ɵ tuƟ ons 
of higher learning, leading edge private sector businesses, and public advocacy organizaƟ ons. Our primary academic partner 
is RIT, a University Transporta Ɵ on Center 
(UTC) consor Ɵ um member with signi ﬁ cant 
and growing experience in transporta Ɵ on 
research. RIT will coordinate research ac Ɵ viƟ es 
associated with Rochester’s Smart City vision, thereby establishing long-las Ɵ ng partnerships 
with the public and private sector. Our many world class private sector partners will work with the City to deploy their innova Ɵ ve 
advanced transporta Ɵ on technologies, while 
demonstra Ɵ ng proof of concept and leading 
to commercializa Ɵ on that will grow the 
naƟ onal economy and posi Ɵ on America as a 
global leader in these emerging ﬁ elds. These 
companies include: EasyMile, GE, Xerox, IBM, Kodak, and Verdant Global. We an Ɵ cipate 
addiƟ onal public-private partnerships to 
emerge as Rochester moves ahead as the selected city. Our public agency partners involve all levels of government: State (New York State Department of Transporta Ɵ on, the 
Safety & Security Planning & Development Bureau, and Empire State Development), County (Monroe County), and regional (RTS, GTC).
OUR SYSTEM
Arterial Miles
There are 103.96 centerline miles of arterial streets in the City of Rochester.  The vast majority of these streets are within the City’s jurisdicƟ on.
Freeway Miles
There are 14.95 centerline miles of freeway in the City of Rochester, all under the jurisdic Ɵ on 
of New York State.
Transit Services
Rochester Transit Service (RTS) currently operates more than 41 routes serving the city and neighboring suburbs. More than 17 million riders u Ɵ lized RTS in 2013. The $40 
million RTS Transit Center opened to the public in November 2014. The Transit Center created a centralized, indoor transfer point for bus patrons at the heart of the Downtown InnovaƟ on Zone.
RTS also provides paratransit service for over 175,000 riders in accordance with the Americans with Disabili Ɵ es Act (ADA) to 
cerƟ ﬁ ed customers with limited mobility.  
GTC is currently developing an update to the Public Transporta Ɵ on Human Service 
Coordinated Plan. As part of that e ﬀ ort, GTC 
conducted analyses in support of the USDOT’s Ladders of Opportuni Ɵ es iniƟ aƟ ve. One of 
the analyses included mapping the loca Ɵ on 
of low- and middle-skills jobs in rela Ɵ on to 
concentra Ɵ ons of poverty and ﬁ  xed route 
bus service. This is shown on the map on the following page. 
City of Rochester, NY | 21ROC FORWARD»»»Shared-Use Mobility 
Services
Carsharing services in the City of Rochester 
are currently o ﬀ ered through Zipcar. There are 
currently eight Zipcars available in the City and another two vehicles just south of the city at RIT. Zipcar and the City are working together to grow the availability of carshare services in the city. Zipcar is a partner in our Smart City vision. Although bikesharing is not currently available in Rochester, the City an Ɵ cipates an 
iniƟ al rollout as soon as summer 2016. Zagster, 
a bikeshare service provider, is a partner in our Smart City vision. Ridesharing services such as Uber and Ly Ō  are not currently able to operate 
in New York State, outside of New York City. The City of Rochester is suppor Ɵ ve of pending 
legislaƟ on in Albany to permit ridesharing 
services to operate statewide. The City anƟ cipates this legisla Ɵ on will be approved in 
2016. 
GTC is the sponsor of roceasyride, a free, 
easy-to-use online trip planning tool that helps people iden Ɵ fy opƟ ons to save money and 
protect the environment by riding the bus, carpooling, and bicycling. It includes features that make it easy to track the cost savings and the environmental bene ﬁ ts that result.

There is an extensive municipal ﬁ ber network 
within the City of Rochester that possesses 
excess capacity. The City and Monroe County are working together to take advantage of this resource, with par Ɵ cular interest in 
considering a municipal wi- ﬁ  network. This 
ﬁ ber backbone is a signi ﬁ cant advantage 
for the deployment of Smart City Challenge elements. 
Intelligent Transporta Ɵ on 
Systems
The Greater Rochester area is a recognized naƟ onal leader in regional coordina Ɵ on 
for Intelligent Transporta Ɵ on Systems 
(ITS) implementa Ɵ on. GTC facilitates a 
Transporta Ɵ on Management Commi Ʃ ee 
(TMC) that provides a forum for regional cooperaƟ on on ITS and opera Ɵ ons issues. 
The City of Rochester is an ac Ɵ ve parƟ cipant 
on the TMC and rou Ɵ nely collaborates with 
Monroe County Department of Transporta Ɵ on, 
which serves as the City’s tra ﬃ  c engineer, and 
NYSDOT. On the strength of this and other iniƟ aƟ ves, regional agencies have deployed 
hundreds of ITS ﬁ eld devices as well as central 
control and communica Ɵ ons infrastructure 
impacƟ ng every mode of transporta Ɵ on in 
the region. As the facilitator of the TMC, GTC serves as the “gatekeeper” of the federally-mandated Regional ITS Architecture and works with all stakeholders to ensure relevant ITS elements and processes are consistent with the Regional ITS Architecture.
A forthcoming endeavor of GTC, with oversight 
of the TMC, is a Transporta Ɵ on System 
Management and Opera Ɵ ons (TSMO) Strategic 
Plan to update the exis Ɵ ng ITS Strategic 
Plan that was adopted in 2011. The TSMO Strategic Plan will look at all exis Ɵ ng and 
planned ITS elements and lay the groundwork for the implementa Ɵ on of connected and 
autonomous vehicles in the region.Smart Grid
In partnership with Energe Ɵ cs and the 
Electriﬁ  caƟ on CoaliƟ on, the City is currently 
assisƟ ng with development of the Electric 
Vehicle (EV) Market Development Program using funding from the New York State Energy Research & Development Authority’s Cleaner Greener CommuniƟ  es Program. The 
goal of this market development program is to sƟ mulate and expand the market for EV 
purchases. It uses a three-pronged approach of installing EV charging sta Ɵ ons, oﬀ ering 
EV incenƟ ves, and conduc Ɵ ng outreach. 
It leverages and builds on prior NYSERDA sponsored projects and EV ini Ɵ aƟ ves, including 
EV-readiness resources, ChargeNY website, regional EV charging sta Ɵ on plans, City of 
Rochester’s EVSE demonstra Ɵ on project, and 
EV tourism study for Mid-Hudson. Innova Ɵ ve 
eﬀ orts are proposed that directly support 
Governor’s ChargeNY ini Ɵ aƟ ve. 
First, implemen Ɵ ng EV Charging Sta Ɵ on Plans 
for the ﬁ  ve regions along the I-90 Corridor 
(Capital District, Mohawk Valley, Central New York, Genesee Valley/Finger Lakes, and Western New York) will spur EV acceptance and adop Ɵ on in regions that lag behind 
NYC’s and Long Island’s embrace of this clean technology. The outcome will be: 
 »25 EV charging sta Ɵ ons (5 in each region) 
strategically installed in cri Ɵ cal areas to 
enable greater EV use. 
 »Educated municipali Ɵ es on EV charging 
staƟ on permi ƫ  ng and communi Ɵ es on EV 
technology. 
 »900 rebates for EV purchases to spur EV sales and establish more EV advocates (the new EV owners), and 
 »40 ride-n-drive events to promote EVs and allow consumers a test drive opportunity of diﬀ erent makes and models.
Second, the Rochester EV Deployment Community will foster a model EV Community in which EVs are embraced by the public and promoted by business and government. This approach moves EVs from a niche product into a dominant and ubiquitous concept. The outcomes will be: 
 »9 EV charging sta Ɵ ons in City of Rochester 
g
arages for public and city-owned EVs. 
City of Rochester, NY | 23ROC FORWARD»»» »EVs for the City of Rochester as an 
ambassador of the technology and to showcase their opera Ɵ on. 
 »extensive community engagement to inform and educate the residents and businesses throughout the City about the bene ﬁ ts of EVs. The Rochester EV 
Deployment Community will create replicable models for other New York communi Ɵ es to use for accelera Ɵ ng EV 
adopƟ on.
DATA COLLECTION
Current Data Collec Ɵ on
The City has been con Ɵ nuously building 
capacity to capture and analyze data to inform decision making and measure outcomes. It has a history of sound prac Ɵ ce in these areas 
especially in areas of grant management outcome tracking and in the investment and planning decisions in the Department of Neighborhood and Business Development.
The City recently overhauled its Geographic 
InformaƟ on Systems and related IT 
infrastructure. This has greatly improved the access and sharing of data within the City organizaƟ ons of not only of GIS data, but all 
the City source data and other available public data.
In spring 2015 the City launched the O ﬃ  ce of 
InnovaƟ on and Strategic Ini Ɵ aƟ ves, a research 
and strategy team repor Ɵ ng to Mayor Lovely 
A. Warren. One major focus of the team is to 
ensure that scien Ɵ ﬁ c tracking and outcome 
measurement are the founda Ɵ on of any new 
City iniƟ aƟ ves. This is not only to help evaluate 
progress and track success, but also to posi Ɵ on 
iniƟ aƟ ves for more sustainable funding 
opportuni Ɵ es. 
The City and the O ﬃ  ce of Innova Ɵ on is an 
integral partner in the Rochester Monroe AnƟ poverty Ini Ɵ aƟ ve (RMAPI), a large 
consorƟ um of government and non-pro ﬁ ts 
working to impact poverty in Rochester. Together, the RMAPI and the City will insƟ tute an an Ɵ -poverty program in a pilot district to test e ﬀ ecƟ veness and measure 
impact. Through this partnership, the O ﬃ  ce 
of Innova Ɵ on will work with local and 
state experts to design metric tracking that taps into data assets from non-pro ﬁ ts and 
government agencies to track long-term individual outcomes and geographic trends. It will also work to implement best prac Ɵ ces 
in data security, and privacy standards. As these programs move toward implementa Ɵ on, 
staﬀ  responsible for sensi Ɵ ve personal data 
will undergo training on privacy and security protocol. 
The City currently has in place data sharing 
agreements with the City School District, the 
loc
al Library system, and Monroe County. It 
shares data on students, library patrons, and recreaƟ on center users. The City primarily 
shares property assessment data and street asset data with the County. The City has also has expanded data sharing in partnership with Gov. Cuomo’s Open NY data ini Ɵ aƟ ve. The 
Police Department also receives shared data from the NYS Department of CorrecƟ  ons and 
Community Supervision and other state and federal law enforcement agencies to help track and improve police strategy.
We have experience in and can leverage 
data from a variety of sources such as tra ﬃ  c 
cameras, other sensors, and social media to enable opportuni Ɵ es to opƟ mize opera Ɵ ons 
(traﬃ  c ﬂ ow, automated tra ﬃ  c sign detecƟ  on, 
and recogni Ɵ on), monitor infrastructure 
condiƟ ons (road condi Ɵ ons, snow condi Ɵ ons, 
pot holes), infrastructure planning (public transit), tra ﬃ  c enforcement (detec Ɵ ng 
passenger compartment viola Ɵ ons, speeding 
violaƟ ons), popula Ɵ on senƟ ment detec Ɵ on 
for city agency policies, and system health monitoring.
In addiƟ on to City data collec Ɵ on systems, 
Genesee Transporta Ɵ on Council (GTC) 
commissions an annual land use monitoring 
project conducted by the Monroe County Department of Planning and Development that includes the City of Rochester. The most recent year for which data collec Ɵ on and analysis is 
complete is 2014. 
GTC has also contracted with INRIX to provide 
probe-based travel Ɵ  me data for the region, 
City of Rochester, NY | 24ROC FORWARD»»»including access to INRIX Analy Ɵ cs. GTC 
has access to historic and real- Ɵ me travel 
data. GTC’s agreement with INRIX allows 
for member agencies, including the City of Rochester, to access and use this data.
GTC supports the Monroe County Department 
of Transporta Ɵ on’s (MCDOT) e ﬀ ort to collect 
traﬃ  c volume and classi ﬁ caƟ on counts 
in the City on a periodic basis. This data complements the e ﬀ orts of the New York State 
Department of Transporta Ɵ on (NYSDOT) to 
collect tra ﬃ  c volume and classi ﬁ caƟ on counts 
for the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS).
Further, GTC is responsible for the 
development and on-going maintenance of a Regional Travel Demand Model and regularly conducts analyses for member agencies, including the City of Rochester, and other municipali Ɵ es in the Rochester Metropolitan 
Planning Associa Ɵ on.
Regional Transit Service (RTS) collects the following data for the transit system:
 »Ridership data by route and stop based upon the use of the farebox on the bus.
 »Ridership data by route and stop based upon the number of people who walk on the and o ﬀ  the bus. 
 »Smartcard and fare media pass tracking by serial number.
 »Real-Time GPS loca Ɵ on of the bus at each 
stop.
 »Customer and organiza Ɵ on contact 
InformaƟ on through call center, fare 
media, social media, in person, and through e-mail.
A wealth of data is currently being collected, analyzed and employed to enhance the transporta Ɵ on system and the economic 
environment of the City.
New Data Collec Ɵ on
The essen Ɵ al goal for technologies addressing 
data collec Ɵ on is the wealth of disparate 
systems and data sources involved. This Big Data problem exists in every city today. This inability to collect, analyze, and sharing between the various city transporta Ɵ on 
systems and human service organiza Ɵ ons is 
common to most ci Ɵ es across our na Ɵ on. 
The development of a standardized set of data workﬂ  ow processes, security standards, 
architectural design, and search criteria, will bene ﬁ t many ciƟ  es by reducing this disparate 
data gathering and sharing processes. 
The City and RMAPI are currently working 
closely with the NYS Poverty Task Force, a group of high level state oﬃ   cials to formalize 
data sharing agreements with NYS OTDA/Monroe County Department of Human Services (Public Bene ﬁ ts), NYS Department of 
Labor, and NYS Department of Correc Ɵ ons and 
Community Supervision. We will expand this sharing agreement to include our addi Ɵ onal 
public partners (MCDOT, NYSDOT, RTS) as well as our private partners, (XEROX, IBM, GE, etc.) This will be essen Ɵ al to track and demonstrate 
long term outcomes for individuals interac Ɵ ng 
with the Smart City Challenge team.
The IBM Smarter CiƟ  es Challenge Report, 
dated January 27, 2016, provided a thorough 
outline for data collec Ɵ on and data governance 
as related to an Ɵ -poverty iniƟ  aƟ ves. In a 
coordinaƟ on eﬀ ort, our team will adopt a 
similar structure as described in the following manner:

ARCHITECTURE, STANDARDS & PROCESSES
The City of Rochester and other regional transporta Ɵ on agencies (GTC, Monroe 
County, and NYSDOT) who are par Ɵ cipaƟ ng 
in this project are also par Ɵ cipaƟ ng in the 
development and update of the Rochester’s Regional ITS Architecture. Projects from the 2011 ITS Strategic Plan are integrated into the Regional ITS Architecture and evaluated for consistency with the New York State-wide ITS Architecture. Updates to the Regional ITS Architecture are undertaken as o Ō en as 
needed. The 2011 ITS Strategic Plan called for applying a consistent set of standards to tra ﬃ  c 
signals, communica Ɵ ons, and data interchange 
across the region. All projects undergo a governance review to ensure they conform to the recommenda Ɵ ons of the strategic plan and 
ITS architecture. Furthermore, when developing the system requirements for our Smart City vision we will ensure compliancy with IEEE and ISO Standards as established by IEEE 1233: correct, compaƟ ble, complete, feasible, veri ﬁ able, 
traceable, and modi ﬁ able. The requirements 
will be developed based on USDOT guidance as well.
With respect to interacƟ  ng and sharing lessons 
learned with the standards development 
organizaƟ ons (SDOs), a number of state and 
regional transporta Ɵ on staﬀ  are acƟ ve and 
parƟ cipate in ITS standard development 
eﬀ orts. Our private sector partners are 
naƟ onal and interna Ɵ onal leaders in the US

Koorosh Olyai is the chair of the US delega Ɵ on 
to the Interna Ɵ onal Standards Organiza Ɵ on 
Technical Commi Ʃ ee 204 (ISO TC 204) which is 
responsible for development of ITS Standards as well as a harmonized connected vehicle (CV) suite of standards. Our team members are also members of the SAE and IEEE connected vehicle and communica Ɵ ons standards groups 
who are promulga Ɵ ng Internet of Things (IoT), 
Communica Ɵ ons (DSRC), Big Data, Connected 
Vehicle (CV) and Automated Vehicle (AV) standards. These are cri Ɵ cal in deploying a 
consistent set of standards for this challenge. We strongly support development of standards for interoperability purposes na Ɵ onally.

GOALS & OBJECTIVES
When you look at the history of transporta Ɵ on 
in our community, the economy of the City of Rochester has been determined in no small part by transporta Ɵ on assets, such as 
the Erie Canal, the railroads, and the growth of the interstate system. Now, building on these assets, the City of Rochester’s vision is structured to strengthen our transporta Ɵ on 
network in the 21st Century by leveraging advanced technologies to address the challenges we have in safety, mobility, sustainability, economic vitality, and climate change. Rochester is ready to connect everything.
Rochester will move be Ʃ er by 
enhancing mobility.
In the 21st Century, Rochester will focus on the overall connec Ɵ vity of our neighborhoods. We 
will provide Rochesterians with the needed access to reliable, a ﬀ ordable transporta Ɵ on 
that provides opportuni Ɵ es for employment, 
child care, health care, educa Ɵ on, as well as 
all of the other services residents and families need. As men Ɵ oned previously, Rochester 
has the second-highest poverty rate in the naƟ on, resul Ɵ ng in a situa Ɵ on that threatens 
our community’s economic future. Enhanced mobility is one avenue to help turn this situaƟ on around.
 »Rochester will test automated vehicle performance in a four-season climate. 
 »Rochester will demonstrate that an enhanced transit service can make a posiƟ ve impact on low income residents. 
 »Rochester will provide real- Ɵ me traveler 
informaƟ on and emerging mobility services 
to improve personal mobility. 
 »Rochester will increase mobility for pedestrian and bicycle access. »Rochester will focus mobility improvements on our overall demographics (e.g. aging popula Ɵ on, 
disabled, millennials, etc.). 
Rochester will improve safety.
By using advanced technologies, including CV technologies, Rochester will reduce the number and severity of collisions, resul Ɵ ng in 
fewer fataliƟ  es and injuries.E ﬃ  ciency is at the 
forefront of Rochester’s vision for the future. 
Rochester will focus on crea Ɵ ng a connected 
community that will provide the infrastructure 
for the future. 
 »In the 21st Century, everyone needs the ability to be connected and therefore the City of Rochester will be incorpora Ɵ ng a 
City-wide Wi-Fi network. 
 »Smart Road technology will also be incorporated to make sure that every signalized intersec Ɵ on within the City of 
Rochester has the ability to adapt to the changing tra ﬃ  c condiƟ ons. 
Rochester will build for a 
sustainable future. 
Rochester’s primary goal is to build a thriving 
liveable community throughout the city that provides access, neighborhood cohesion, opportunity, economic compe Ɵ Ɵ veness, and a 
“sense of place.” 
Rochester will adapt to a changing 
climate. 
The technologies implemented by the City 
of Rochester will support a more sustainable relaƟ onship between transporta Ɵ on and the 
environment through fuel use and emissions reducƟ  ons. 
Upon selecƟ  on as a Smart City Challenge 
Finalist, the City of Rochester will work with our consor Ɵ um partners to iden Ɵ fy a set of 
targeted performance measures that relate to the primary impact of our deployment. The deployed technologies will be capable of generaƟ ng the data needed to demonstrate 
how well the system is performing with respect to the iden Ɵ ﬁ ed target measures. 
City of Rochester, NY | 27ROC FORWARD»»»EVIDENCE OF 
CAPACITY
The City of Rochester has a long history of delivering high-quality, large-scale public projects u Ɵ lizing federal funding. The most 
current example of this is the Inner Loop East Transforma Ɵ on project, currently under 
construcƟ  on. This $24 million project received 
$17.7 million in TIGER funding in 2013 to remove a deteriorated and underu Ɵ lized 
secƟ on of the Inner Loop Expressway in 
Downtown Rochester and replace it with a new high quality complete street. This project will reconnect neighborhoods, remove structurally-de ﬁ cient bridges, encourage 
walking and biking, and create over six acres of land for redevelopment that will generate jobs and leverage private investment. This project is being developed by the City of Rochester on schedule and on budget. Other Recent examples of major federally-funded City transporta Ɵ on projects include:
 »Midtown Rising Redevelopment , a $100 
million project, is signi ﬁ cantly shaping the 
rebirth of the downtown core through major public and private investment, job creaƟ on, and infrastructure 
development. At the heart of the project is the rehabilita Ɵ on of the nearly 9-acre 
former Midtown Plaza into a mixed-use area designed to a Ʃ ract a criƟ  cal 
mass of residents and 24/7 ameni Ɵ es 
that contribute to a vibrant live-work environment. This project has created a resurgence of downtown acƟ  vity and is 
currently rede ﬁ ning Rochester’s City Center 
for future genera Ɵ ons. 
 »The Broad Street Tunnel Reconstruc Ɵ on 
project , a $23 million project completed 
in 2011 which ﬁ lled in a deteriora Ɵ ng 
subsurface tunnel and fully reconstructed a major surface arterial. 
 »The Port of Rochester Infrastructure Improvements project , a $40 million 
project that constructed new streets, sidewalks, ligh Ɵ ng, drainage, parking, 
mulƟ -use trails, and public space on 
a previously-unde ﬁ ned parking area 
surrounding the historic Port Terminal Building. 
Ground Breaking Ceremony for the Inner Loop East Transforma Ɵ on Project
City of Rochester, NY | 28ROC FORWARD»»»ExecuƟ  ve Commitment:  The City of Rochester 
will be the grant recipient and primary point 
of contact responsible for federal grant administra Ɵ on and repor Ɵ ng procedures. 
Mayor Lovely Warren, as demonstrated by the cover leƩ er to this applica Ɵ on, is commi Ʃ ed to 
successful delivery of our Smart City vision.
Workforce Capacity:  The City of Rochester has 
an excellent working rela Ɵ onship with local 
labor unions. In fact, for three of the projects 
listed above, the City developed project labor agreements (PLA’s) with the local unions to assure that su ﬃ  cient workforce capacity is 
available in the Region. The City of Rochester, along with the local unions, is very proud of their teaming abili Ɵ es and past successes. 
Likewise, the region has well-established partnerships for workforce development through regional academic partners such as Monroe Community College. Should Rochester be chosen as a Smart City Challenge ﬁ nalist, 
the City will work with regional partners to create a workforce development strategy to ensure that the local labor force is ready and equipped for the economic opportuni Ɵ es that 
will arise.
Degree of Infrastructure Readiness:  The 
transporta Ɵ on infrastructure of the City of 
Rochester is already well-prepared to meet the 
needs of the Smart City Challenge. The tra ﬃ  c 
signal system is computerized and coordinated remotely from the Regional Tra ﬃ  c OperaƟ ons 
Center, where tra ﬃ  c monitoring capabili Ɵ es 
are acƟ ve 24/7. Likewise, the RTS transit ﬂ  eet 
is ouƞ iƩ ed with CAD/AVL and provides real-
Ɵ me arrival and status informa Ɵ on to the 
public through mul Ɵ ple plaƞ orms. There is an 
expansive municipal ﬁ ber network in the city 
with excess capacity.
Data & Performance Management 
CapabiliƟ es: The City and consor Ɵ um 
partners already collect and analyze data for a wide variety of municipal applica Ɵ ons and 
public informa Ɵ on. The City’s Department 
of Informa Ɵ on Technology is well aware of 
the Smart City Challenge and is prepared to accommodate any and all requirements in coordinaƟ on with our partners.LEVERAGING FEDERAL RESOURCES
It is anƟ cipated that opportuni Ɵ es for cost-
sharing and in-kind service delivery will be made available through the City and its project partners. The ability to leverage the federal resources provided through the Smart City Challenge to a Ʃ ract addi Ɵ onal ﬁ nancial and 
technical assistance will help to ensure that Rochester’s Smart City vision produces a real and long-las Ɵ ng impact on Rochester, New 
York State, and the na Ɵ on as a whole. Upon 
noƟ ﬁ caƟ on as a Smart City Challenge ﬁ nalist, 
the City will work with our consor Ɵ um of 
partners to secure commitments to leverage addiƟ onal funding and/or in-kind products and 
services. 
ROC Forward: creaƟ  ng a smart, sustainable 
city for the 21st Century.

MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE

 1. Define your vision for your Smart City.  
The Smart City Challenge will help the City of Memphis create new partnerships and deploy 
emerging technology to lower the net transactional cost of travelling around a city that is 
geographically over -built and has a sparse population. Through this challenge, Memphis will 
further develop its current infrastructure, systems, and plans to better use automation and 
analytics to shrink the impact of this sprawling environment. Memphis wi ll partner with global 
industry leaders including FedEx to develop and implement a n advanced, inter connected, smart, 
safe, convenient and sustainable transportation system demonstration to overcome the 
geographical mismatch between jobs and workers within a specific region of the city.  Resources 
available through this grant can fundamentally change Memphis , increasing the quality of life 
and productivity of its citizens while decreasing their cost of living.  
In Memphis, public and private sectors are rally ing around transportation choices and 
particularly transit like never before. Memphis is pursuing cutting edge technology, data, and 
innovation to move people, driven by the same urgency with which a package moves from 
Memphis to anywhere in the world in e ight hours or less. Memphis has the brightest minds in 
transportation and logistics at FedEx and is forming new public -private partnerships to help 
solve its transportation challenges. Top leadership within all sectors – public, private, higher 
education, philanthropy, and community advocates – are committed to the Smart City Challenge 
and proving what improved and integrated transport and logistics can mean to a mid -sized  U.S. 
city. To that end, we have created the Memphis Smart City Transportation Allianc e to coordinate 
the proposal and  hopefully  implementation of the Smart City Challenge. Partners in the Alliance 
include: FedEx, MATA, and the University of Memphis (see #7 for the full list of partners). As a 
city, as a community and as a global leader in transport and logistics, Memphis is primed  for the 
Smart City Challenge.  
Memphis' vision is for people, packages, traffic, and cargo to move non -stop through a seamless 
technologically -connected system.  This transportation system encompasses all modes and 
features  a public transit system that includes a fleet of vehicles both publicly and privately 
owned that connect people regardless of age, income, and physical ability. The system will grow 
purposefully  to improve mobility and access to jobs, decrease pol lution and the use of single 
occupancy personal vehicles, make roadways safer for all users, and reduce  the inefficient 
movement of traffic and freight. It will connect all Memphians with the goods, the destinations, 
and community they seek.   
 
A user will  be able to utilize smart phones or other hand -held devices to plan, purchase, and 
track trips from origin to destination in a safe , cost-effective manner using multiple modes such 
as bus, bike, Uber, or taxi. Using real -time information on smart devices e nables tracking the 
arrival of the next scheduled bus or taxi to get people from home to work or confirm that a bike 
share or Zipcar will be available upon their arrival downtown.  
 MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE

 To accomplish this  vision, Memphis will work to address two significant challenges: 1) 
overcoming the geographical disconnect between where Memphians live and where they work; 
and 2) developing ways for goods to slip quietly and cleanly into and out of the city.  
 
These two challenges are uniquely interrelated in Memphis. Memphis is America’s distribution 
center and is the global leader in transportation, distribution, and logistics. In 2014, Memphis 
International Airport ranked as the number one airport in the U.S. in landed  cargo weight and 
number two globally. Memphis is home to five Class I railroads, the fourth -largest U.S. inland 
port, and the connect ion between  four interstate highways.  
The strength of Memphis’ transportation, distribution, and logistics industries is d emonstrated by 
the city’s location quotients (the relative distribution of employment locally versus the national 
average, Table 1).   Memphis has 10.7 times the national average of the distribution of 
employment in couriers and messengers, almost 3.4 times  as much in warehousing and storage, 
and 2.4 times as much in truck transportation.

And yet, Memphians struggle to reach the job opportunities that the logistics economy presents. 
Only 20% of Memphis residents can access the typical job in under 90 minutes using transit. 
Overall, 11,000 jobs in the Memp his metro area remain unfilled. Sprawl and suburbanization of 
job centers have led to a mismatch between where our citizens live and where they work. And 
while the logistics industry represents an opportunity for growth and new employment, its 
location at the city limits augments the geographical challenges that we face in connecting 
unemployed Memphians with work.  
Those challenges are critical in a city with a poverty rate of nearly 30% and an unemployment 
rate that’s the second highest among major U.S. me tros (population of one million or more). 
Memphis tops city rankings for household income spe nt on transportation (24% ). However, these  
challenges can be overcome. Connecting Memphians with just half of the city’s unfilled jobs MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
4 
 would reduce unemployment by  1%. Filling all of the unfilled jobs would boost our employment 
ranking to 20th out of the 51 major U.S. metros.  
Among the nation’s largest metro areas, Memphis ranked 5th mo st dangerous for pedestrians. 
Transportation for America, a national traffic safe ty coalition, released a study in 2014 ranking 
the danger to pedestrians in the country’s metro areas. It ranks each city on its Pedestrian Danger 
Index . The PDI is based on the relationship of pedestrian fatalities to the percent of residents 
walking to work. The largest number of pedestrian deaths  in Memphis  was 30 in 2013. Last year, 
23 pedestrians were killed. On average, 15 pedestrians are kille d each year in Memphis.  
Grant funds will be used to develop a demonstration project in the proposed study area that 
improve s access to employment through flexible transit services as well as to enhance the 
efficiency of goods movement. Access to modern, flexible transit services will also allow 
residents to utilize local activity nodes providing a variety of personal and leisure services.  
Memphis must improve the movement of both people and good s; this will be accomplished 
through the following efforts:  
1. SMART NETWORKS: Lay the groundwork for a future -forward, sustainable transportation 
network that includes electric / alternative energy vehicles, autonomous trucks and a 
comprehensive fiber optic/ Bluetooth and sensor network  
2. MULTIMODAL DYNAMIC TRANSIT OPERATIONS: Create an innovative program and 
rider -centric application that allows residents to seamlessly combine multiple public and 
private transportation options for more efficient and cost effect ive transportation  
3. TRANSPORTATION AIDED PROGRAM: Develop a real -time interface for transportation 
and logistics providers to proactively and collaboratively respond to transportation needs and 
challenges, such as traffic congestion. Implement an intelligen t routing system for moving 
people and goods across the city  
4. TRANSPORTATION INFORMATION WAREHOUSE: Develop a robust data 
infrastructure that enables all stakeholders to make more informed routing, planning and 
investment decisions  
5. COMPLETE STREETS INFRASTR UCTURE: Invest in data -driven safety and 
infrastructure improvements that facilitate walking, biking and shared or public 
transportation usage  
 
2. Describe the population characteristics of your city.   
The City of Memphis is a p rime example of a U.S. mid -size city both in its demographic 
characteristics and the challenges it faces in meeting the transportation needs of its population.  
In addition to being a typical example of a mid -sized U.S. city, the City of Memphis also 
struggles  with a poverty rate of 27.4% and unemployment of 6.1%, both above the national 
averages of 14.8% and 5.0%. (Census ACS 2010 – 2014, BLS November 2015) . These MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
5 
 characteristics make Memphis  an excellent choice for the U.S. Department of Transportation’s 
Smar t City Challenge . 
The USDOT defines a mid -size city as having a population between 200,000 and 850,000 
people.  The City of Memphis’ population is 646,889. The USDOT is seeking a city that has the 
appropriate density to implement a Smart City initiative.  There are 95 cities in the 2010 Census 
that have populations that fall between the range of a mid -sized city as defined by the USDOT.   
The median density of these 95 cities is 3,218 people/mile. The population density of the City of 
Memphis is 2,054 peopl e/mile. (Census 2010)   
While lower than the median, the density reflects the sprawl that Memphis and many other mid -
sized cities face and will continue to face. This lack of  density creates the demand for new 
technology to meet the transportation needs of populations where traditional public 
transportation strategies found in large densely populated urban cities has fallen short.   
Memphis is home to FedEx World Headquarters and its Distribution Center and a BNSF 
Intermodal Facility located in a transportat ion related employment center in the southern portion 
of the City. The FedEx Distribution Center is located at the Memphis International Airport, 
which is the world’s second busiest cargo airport  according to Airport Council International. The 
proposed stu dy area consists of seven zip codes that create a corridor in the southern portion of 
the City. The corridor encompasses this transportation -related employment center and a 
population of 190,061, 29% of the City’s population. (Census 2010) This corridor ma kes up 37% 
of the City’s primary employment, 31% of which is associated with transportation and 
warehousing. (Census, LEHD, 2013)   
The study area is currently served by several bus routes with the Winchester Road bus route 
serving as a primary public tran sportation corridor running through the center of the study area. 
The Memphis Area Transit Authority (MATA) operates  two public transportation centers located 
within the study area, the Airways Transit Center and the American Way Transit Center. 
Dedicated bike lanes have been added in the past five years. The western portion of the study 
area also includes the Pidgeon Industrial Park where a future industrial and transportation -related 
employment center has been planned.  
The City of Memphis and th e demonstration  study area provide an excellent case study and 
opportunity to develop a Smart City transportation initiative that can be replicated in other U.S. 
mid-sized  cities. This is due to Memphis ’ demographic characteristics and the transportation 
challenges that occur in mid -size cities with low density. New technologies and strategies will be 
used to address transportation barriers contributing to poverty and unemployment in Memphis . 
 
3. Describe the characteristics of your city and show how it aligns  with the USDOT’s 
characteristics of a Smart City.  
 MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE

 a.  Existing public transportation system;  
 
MATA provides public mass transportation in the City of Memphis, as well as portions of the 
City of Bartlett and Lakeland (Paratransit Service), City of Germantown, and unincorporated 
Shelby County, Tennessee. MATA’s mission is to provide a reliable, safe,  accessible, clean 
and customer -friendly public transportation system that meets the needs of the community. 
MATA provides fixed route bus and paratransit services throughout the service area, and rail 
trolley service in the downtown area.  The Fixed Route  bus system operates 365 days a year 
on 32 routes with annual ridership of about 7.9 million passengers. MATAPlus Paratransit 
service for individuals with disabilities operates in the same areas and the same times as 
fixed route service. MATA’s trolley shuttle service operat es along seven miles of track in 
downtown  and midtown  Memphis .  
 
MATA has faced several challenges in recent years; a stagnating or even shrinking budget, 
an overbuilt service area, a growing spatial mismatch between low wage workers and 
employers, and a political environment that has historically favored auto -centric 
transportation planning. However in recent years there has been a promising shift, as more 
Memphis residents and city officials see transit as an essential component for making 
Memphis a thriving, economically competitive city. In the last ten years MATA obtained 
funding for several studies with the purpose of improving the quality of service, including a 
five year Short Range  Transit Plan and a Midtown Alternatives Analys is exploring the 
implementation of Bus Rapid Transit. MATA has also been part of regional planning efforts, 
including the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan, the Aerotropolis Plan, and the MidSouth 
Regional Greenprint’s Transit to Workplace study.  
 
MATA is  also actively pursuing more local funding. MATA recently applied for Surface 
Transportation Program ( STP) funds in the Memphis Metropolitan Planning Organizations 
(MPO) 2017 -2021 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP)  for more buses and for 
“superstop ” locations. MATA is actively collaborating with the City of Memphis, 
community transit advocates, and other partners to produce a white paper exploring possible 
sources of dedicated funding for transit, including local taxes and fees that could increase 
local funding for transit operations and capital improvements. The collaboration occurring 
between the city, MATA, and other community groups shows a growing local commitment 
to support public transit as an integral part of the city’s transportation system.

Approximately 30.0% (45 of 150) of MATA’s vehicle fleet utilize diesel hybrid -electric 
technology.  
b. Environment that is conducive to demonstrating proposed strategies;  
Memphis has a history of entrepreneurship and innovation. Many now world -famous 
businesses started or grew in Memphis such as FedEx, AutoZone, and Holiday Inn. Memphis 
was selected in the first round of cities to incubate a Bloomberg Innovation Delivery Te am 
(Innovate Memphis) that helped grow a culture in city government of risk tolerance and 
willingness to test creative strategies to address persistent problems. In Memphis there exists 
a robust ecosystem of public private partnerships within sectors of go vernment, philanthropy, 
business, and higher education that encourages quick, coordinated action to get things done.  
Examples of this coordinated partnership include the recent large -scale planning and 
implementation efforts like the Airport City Master P lan, MidSouth Regional Greenprint and 
Sustainability Plan , and resilience planning as a part of HUD’s National Disaster Resilience 
Competition (NDRC) which have all proven effective in getting buy in from all sectors.    
 
The proposed grant demonstration a rea has a concentration of logistics, distribution, and 
transportation jobs. The area lacks frequent transit service but has good access to two transit 
hubs and residential areas. Large employers in the area have the motivation and will to work 
with public  partners to solve the puzzle of getting more of citizens to jobs, reducing vehicle 
miles travelled, and preventing traffic and freight congestion.  
 
MATA and the City of Memphis have begun building a system of ITS infrastructure that is 
the backbone of a Smart City. MATA is partner ing with private entities such as Uber, 
TransLoc, and others to provide customers more flexible , on demand service.  
 
MATA is at the forefront of partnering with technology companies that are revolutionizing 
the transportation in dustry. In 2015 , MATA launched TransLoc Rider, which allows transit 
users to see in real time where the bus is and when it will be arriving at the designated stop. 
TransLoc is a transportation technology company founded in 2004, whose products include MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
8 
 Rider  mobile app (available in the iOS App Store or on Google Play), RealTime  control 
center, Traveler  visualization and planning tool and OnDemand  automated demand -response 
system. TransLo c Rider is the official app for 135 municipal, university and corpor ate 
agencies.   
MATA is part of a pilot project in partnership with TransLoc and Uber to integrate Uber and 
transit services. This launch will take place in Memphis in mid -February, and is one of only 
two places nationally (Memphis and Durham , NC ) that will  be piloting this project. The new 
Rider app will allow users to simply input their destination and receive a personalized 
journey that incorporates the optimal combination of walking, transit, and Uber. This is the 
first step in a new user -centric approac h to transportation, allowing users to make use of 
multiple modes of transportation quickly and easily. This partnership will be a crucial 
foundation for building flexible, on demand transit service in Memphis, improving reliability 
of service for existing  riders and making it possible for more people to go car free or car 
light.  
 
MATA also has a long standing history working with Premier Transportation, Memphis’ 
largest cab company. Premier was the original provider of MATAplus paratransit [called 
Handili ft]. MATA has used Premier to test proposed route extensions before making them 
permanent, or determining their feasibility on a short term contract, under very flexible 
terms. Premier has also twice been selected as a sub -recipient for New Freedom funds t o 
purchase wheelchair accessible vehicles. These funds allow Premier the ability to 
accommodate on -demand requests that MATAplus’ reservation requirements exclude, to 
supplement service during MATAplus vehicle shortages or breakdowns, or in the event of 
broken lift/ramps on a main line bus. The partnership with Premier, with its fleet of 
wheelchair accessible vehicles will be a valuable resource in the implementation of the Smart 
Cities grant.  
c. Continuity of committed leadership and capacity to carry out th e demonstration throughout 
the period of performance;  
Leadership in all sectors recognize s that Memphis  will not reach the level of economic 
growth and prosperity its  citizenry deserves without address ing its transportation challenges. 
New Mayor  Jim Strickland was sworn in for a four -year term on January 1, 2016. Before 
taking office the new Mayor's incoming executive team was working with leadership of the 
Greater Memphis Chamber, FedEx, MATA, and the University of Memphis to aggressively 
compet e for this Smart City Challenge.  
The City of Memphis , University of Memphis,  and MATA have a long history of 
collaboration with each other on transportation and many other civic issues. E ach has 
experience in managing millions of federal grant dollars. The City  of Memphis  Law Division MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
9 
 has a grants compliance department to ensure all milestones and targets are met in a timely 
manner and most divisions of government have grants management staff.   
All partners in the Memphis Smart City Transportation Allia nce (currently FedEx , the 
Greater Memphis Chamber, University of Memphis, Metropolitan Planning Organization, 
Innovate Memphis, Memphis Area Transit Authority, Memphis Light Gas and Water, City of 
Memphis, Memphis and Shelby County Airport Authority, Memph is and Shelby County  of 
Planning and Development  / Office of Sustainability, and the Shelby County Healt h 
Department Pollution Control) formed in response to the Smart City Challenge have the staff 
expertise to execute the demonstration and strategies prop osed herein.  All partners are 
committed to continue collaboration and build upon the elements of a Smart City to  
successful ly launch  the Memphis  demonstration.  
 
d. A commitment to integrating with the sharing economy;  
Memphis is committed to enabling the sharing economy to make life better for its citizens 
and visitors. Uber and Lyft operate in the City of Memphis including providing service to 
Memphis International Airport. Ne gotiations are underway with a  selected vendor to launch 
bike share in Memphis i n 2016. Zipcar has a presence in Memphis and will soon expand to 
serve more parts of the city. MATA is partnering with Uber and TransLoc to make the transit 
system better able to serve and communicate with riders. Memphis participates with the 
Shared -Use M obility Center (SUMC), a public -interest organization working to foster 
collaboration in shared mobility (including bike sharing, car sharing, ride sharing and more) 
and help connect the growing shared mobility industry with transit agencies, cities and 
communities across the nation.    
 
e. A clear commitment to making open, machine -readable data accessible, discoverable and 
usable by the public to fuel entrepreneurship and innovation;  
The City of Memphis is committed to providing  accessible  open and machine -readable data 
to the public  to fuel entrepreneurship and innovation . Partners of the Memphis Smart City 
Transportation Alliance will be governed by Memorandums of Understandings (MOUs) 
which outline the datasets, frequency of data updates, and service level agreements 
surrounding the collection and dissemination of the data  for the demonstration project .

 5. Describe how your holistic, integrated approach aligns to the twelve USDOT vision 
elements described in this solicitation.  
 
CONNECTING PEOPLE AND PLACES  
The logistics industry is vital to Memphis' economic base ; the challenge the city faces is how to 
connect low -income, transit -dependent people to jobs  in this sector . Logistics jobs in the 
proposed demonstration area are hard to serve by traditional fixed -route transit (buses). These 
jobs tend to be off -peak hour shift times and are often filled through temp agencies – factors that 
make it difficult for workers to coordinate transportation. The warehouse employmen t 
destinations are on large lots and located far from the street. A poor pedestrian environment 
makes it difficult for transit users to get from stops to the employment destination.  
Funds available through this grant will begin the construction of a Multim odal Dynamic Transit 
Operations (MDTO) application  that provides innovative, flexible transit services and 
multimodal electronic payment systems . This application will allow travelers to request trips on -
demand using a handheld mobile device or a computer.  This app would act as a trip planner that 
evaluates individual travel preferences (for instance, fastest or cheapest route) against network 
conditions to recommend ideal journeys. The app would cover multiple transportation services 
(public transportation  modes, private transportation services, shared -ride, walking , and biking), 
and allow users to pay for their entire trip electronically or with a smart card. MATA would also 
install trip scheduling kiosks  with multiple payment options at key nodes througho ut the area, 
such as transit centers, shopping centers, employment centers , and transit super stops, to better 
accommodate transit users who do not use mobile phones or electronic payment methods.  
To implement this dynamic , on-demand transit service, MATA will partner with Uber, 
TransLoc,  local employers and Transportation Management Associations (TMA), and local bike 
shares to develop a  fleet of transportation options. Residents in the demonstration area will be 
part of the design process to ensure the nee ds of transit user are taken into account when creating 
both the app and overall transit experience. MATA will also develop the optimal mix of fixed 
stops and routes, on -demand direct service transit, and partnerships with private transportation 
companies,  and refine this data based on origin destination data collected from users of the app.  
This application builds on MATA’s existing ITS systems, including Computer Aided Dispatch 
and Automated Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) systems and automated scheduling sof tware, as 
well as connected vehicle technology that would allow transit vehicles and private partners to 
respond and continually modify their routes and trips to meet demand.  
It is anticipated that u sers will take traditional transit services to get to tr ansit centers located in 
the study area , though this will be further validated with the community . By integrating  GPS, 
mobile data terminals, web -based payment, data analytics, and real -time dynamic sched uling , 
smaller flexible shuttles will respond to mov e customers from the transit centers to their job 
destinations.  MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
12 
 To address pedestrian safety, an issue that will grow in importance as use of personal vehicle 
decreases and more people walk or bike for part of their  transportation journey , the City of 
Memp his will prioritize pedestrian safety improvements to infrastructure where  data indicates 
the highest level of pedestrian and bicyclists, or in areas with where there are high volumes of 
transit trips originating. Memphis  will also explore using  the Blueto oth and fiber optic network 
of traffic signals to integrate smart infrastructure applications to warn pedestrians on their mobile 
apps, communicate the presence of pedestrians to connected vehicles, and even give preference 
to pedestrians at certain inters ections.  
MOVING GOODS EFFICIENTLY  
Memphis’ position as a freight -centric community signals the critical need to address congestion 
and safety caused by extremely high truck and rail volumes. The Port of Memphis is  one of the 
nation’s largest inland ports with a concentration of warehouse/distribution centers, and it 
supports major trade routes of national significance that traverse the area. An additional 
consideration  is the high volume  of truck traf fic and the challenge  of delivering goods in the 
urban area.    
Memphis  will immediately begin to use enhanced sensor technology to optimize network flows.  
Basic starting elements include the  existing “Smart Way” system operated by the Tennessee 
Department of Transport ation on the region’s freeway network and the Bluetooth network 
currently being installed on key surface street s. The se networks will provide real -time traffic 
information to improve reliability and reduce delays. The networks will be expanded and linked 
together to provide advanced traveler information to commercial vehicle drivers  through the 
Transportation Aided Program (TAP) . In addition, using approaches based on the Freight 
Advanced Traveler Information System (FRATIS) platform, trucks will be provide d with 
information to select optimal routes and times to utilize the roadway network. The use of electric 
or alternative fuel vehicles to perform the drayage movements will be explored. In addition, for 
certain repetitive routes that are off the major road way network the use of autonomous trucks 
will be investigated and tested.    
The realization of the City’s approach through the application of new and existing technologies 
will smoothly integrate with the following Vision Element Statements:  
 
1. Urban Automa tion: 
Memphis  will aid implement ation of  driver -assisted automated vehicles  in the 
demonstration area  by developing an interconnected transportation infrastructure sensor 
device network. This network will provide drivers with  real time transportation data to 
influence the routing and dispersal of vehicles. Private transportation companies and 
individual transport providers could also utilize th is Transportation Aided Program 
(TAP).  MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
13 
 2. Connected Vehicles:  
The data infrastructure and TAP will allow for the conne ctivity of commercial and 
private vehicles through existing technologies, such as fiber optics, Wi -Fi, Wireless, 
LTE, and Bluetooth technologies.  The vehicles that participate in this program consume 
data and information and return their own data for rese arch and analysis. These additional 
data elements will allow for the analysis of traffic patterns, and movement elements.  
Alerts and notices will also be published through the TAP to allow drivers to adjust their 
routes. Connected vehicle technology will also enable public and private transportation 
carriers to respond immed iately and seamlessly to demand  and coordinate with each 
other . Other  travelers can plan their trip and pay for multiple modes in one easy 
electronic payment.  
3. Intelligent Sensor -based I nfrastructure:  
Memphis  will design, implement, and expand sensor -based infrastructure gathering 
information on vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic. The sensor data will be housed in 
a centralized data repository, known as the Transportation Intelligen ce Warehouse (TIW).  
The City proposes to build upon the existing fiber optic infrastructure already deployed in 
support of the Intelligent Traffic System network and the University of Memphis’s 
Internet 2 network. The University will serve as the central cl earinghouse for our data 
collection efforts and will be responsible for the care and maintenance of the 
clearinghouse technology.  
4. Urban Analytics:  
The combination of the previously identified sensor network and the TIW will allow the 
City to provide a data-rich environment through the TAP a nd other applications 
developed by other public and private groups or individuals. The TIW will also allow 
University of Memphis researchers , FedEx,  and other s to access information that was not 
previously available. This  information will provide research opportunities to enhance and 
develop new traffic algorithms from which Memphis  and other cities will be able to route 
public, private, and commercial traffic.  Through the analysis of traffic and weather 
patterns, the City  of Memphis can send alerts or requests to limit movement in specific 
locations , which  will help to reduce emissions.  
5. User -Focused Mobility Services and Choices:  
The system of Multimodal Dynamic Transit Operations is a user -focused system that will 
make it  easier for travelers to plan their trips, simplify payment, and make it easier for 
more people to reduce car usage. Payment stations and monitors, and/or the use of 
payment cards will also make these transit options accessible to people who do not use 
smart phones or electronic payment methods. The system design will incorporate input 
from residents and employers in the demonstration area to insure the solution is intuitive MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
14 
 and effective. This will not only yield a better design, but also help us to recrui t early 
users.  
The development of the TAP and TIW provide the infrastructure and data elements 
necessary for Memphis citizens and leaders to make strategic and tactical transportation 
choices. T actical  choices may include  whether  to use mass transit, priva te commercial 
transportation, or other choices such as ride  share or bike share.  This technology  can be 
deployed  at existing bus stops, libraries, and community centers for citizens to “call” for  
a variety of  transportation options.  
6. Urban Delivery and Logistics:  
As mentioned in Vision Element #4, the TAP and TIW components will allow for 
transportation, delivery, and logistical providers to implement new delivery modes and 
efficient routes that will utilize real time data to reduce idling and decrease c arbon 
emissions. Memphis has a dense freight and logistics corridor in the d emonstration area. 
Memphis  proposes to test intelligent routing of freight and logistic vehicles, as well as 
utilizing the urban automation elements mentioned previously to transpo rt workers to and 
from their place of employment.  
7. Strategic Business Models and Partnering Opportunities:  
The City of Memphis is connecting with private and public entities in support of this 
demonstration . Partners include  but are not limited to  FedEx, BNSF, Memphis Area 
Transport Authority, Memphis Light Gas and Water, University of Memphis, Memphis 
Chamber of Commerce, and The FedEx Institute of Technology  at UofM . This 
collaboration w ill be able to expand to include new partners. The City of Memphis has 
had initial discussions with technology providers and vehicle manufacturers to deploy 
cutting edge technology to provide a unified transportation ecosystem.  
8. Smart Grid, Roadway Electrification and Electric Vehicles:  
Through the development of a unified t ransportation ecosystem Memphis  proposes to 
deploy an infrastructure that builds upon and expands the existing Intelligent 
Transportation System and Smart Grid environment to provide real time information. For 
example, based on location -aware technology and  sensors, the system will inform EV 
drivers of the distance and time to the next EV charging station. Memphis  also plans to 
build and deploy EV charging stations at public locations such as libraries, community 
centers, parks, fire stations, and police pre cincts.  
9. Connected, Involved Citizens:  
The TAP and TIW infrastructures connect citizens and allow their active involvement in 
their transportation choices. Many citizens in the demonstration area have historically not 
had a voice in how their neighborhoods have developed. This effort will give citizens, MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
15 
 particularly those without personal vehicles, more choice and control in their daily lives. 
For example, as  a citizen gets ready to leave their apartment or home, they can access the 
TAP and view which transportation options are available for their use. They will be able 
to see estimated arrival times for mass transit and whether a ride share vehicle or bicycle  
are available. The TAP and TIW will let citizens and citizen’s groups communicate and 
provide direct feedback on services and operations.  In addition to allowing travelers to 
plan and pay for multimodal trips on demand, the app used for the MDTO will als o offer 
opportunities for citizens to provide feedback or report current travel conditions.  
10. Architectures and Standards:  
The TAP and TIW infrastructures will be designed using existing frameworks such as the 
National ITS Architecture, Connected Vehicle Ref erence Implementation (CVRIA).  
11. Low-Cost, Efficient, Secure and Resilient Information and Communications Technology 
(ICT):  
Through the development of our interconnected tra nsportation environment Memphis  
will use the National Institutes of Technology (NIST)  framework when designing and 
deploying the technol ogy and infrastructure. Memphis  intends to deploy solar technology 
as the primary and, if applicable, the secondary method to power deployed technology 
elements. This is an example of how resiliency will b e built into this demonstration .  
Another example is to install redundant communication paths utilizing fiber optic and 
wireless technology.  
12. Smart Land Use:  
Our newly designed transportation environment  will be layered into future plans and  
existing neighb orhood master plans  and regulations , including the Aerotropolis Plan and 
the Unified Development Code (UDC), a form -based code that allows higher density 
mixed -use development and incorporates land subdivision regulations and zoning into a 
single document . This will assist in planning and development for new areas and the 
redevelopment of blighted areas. For example, enhanced transportation offerings will 
increase the desirability of a neighborhood , encourage  infill  development,  and discourage 
urban sprawl.  Data about high concentrations of pedestrians or large volumes of trip 
requests will also enable the city to focus its efforts in building infrastructure that 
improves pedestrian and bicycle safety using Complete Streets principles and guidelines 
already adopted by the City of Memphis.  
6.  Identify and rate key technical, policy, and institutional risks associated with the 
deployment vision and discuss plans for mitigating those risks.  
Risk is inherent when  adopting a slew of new technologies . In the demonstration, risk will b e 
lessened by the sensor research specialty at the U niversity of Memphis  and the expertise offered MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
16 
 by FedEx.  Other r isks include incurring cost of future system maintenance, future liability 
associated with automation, traffic net work hacking, and compromise of city network. Policies 
must be constantly reviewed and updated to adequately address concerns such as privacy , data 
governance, guidelines for  providing open data , and addressing security concerns.  
7. Outline team partners, key  stakeholders, and demonstration governance processes.  
The Memphis Smart City Transportation Alliance is the working group advancing this proposal 
and shall  stay in place to implement solutions in the demonstration area and eventually on a 
citywide scale. Current Alliance members are FedEx , the Greater Memphis Chamber, University 
of Memphis, Metropolitan Planning Organization, Innovate Memphis, Memphis Area Transit 
Authority, Memphis Light Gas and Water, City of Memphis, Memphis and Shelby County 
Airport Au thority, Memphis and Shelby County  of Planning and Development  / Office of 
Sustainability, and the Shelby County Health Department Pollution Control. Other partners in 
future may include employers partnering in a Transportation Management Association in th e 
demonstration area, transportation companies providing additional service in the demonstration, 
and groups that have worked on past Memphis planning efforts such as Nelson/Nygaard and 
Center for Neighbor hood Technology. The Alliance will be governed by a  board with a 
representative  from each partner organization appointed to serve. The board may adopt rules, 
hire staff, and enter contracts necessary to advance its mission to monitor the demonstration 
project , ensure strategies are implemented, metrics are  tracked, and program design is constantly 
evaluated and revised when necessary.  
8. Describe existing transportation infrastructure and system features in your city.  
a. Arterial miles: 511  
b. Freeway miles: 63, Other roads miles: 2,108  
c. Transit services  
 
The Memphis Area Transit Authority (MATA) provides public mass transportation in the 
City, and portions of the City of Bartlett and Lakeland (Paratransit Service), City of 
Germantown, and unincorporated Shelby County, Tennessee. A contract service is also 
operated in the City of West Memphis, Arkansas. MATA provides fixed route bus and 
paratransit services throughout the service area, and rail trolley service in the downtown area.  
Annual ridership is about 7.9 million passengers. The Fixed Route bus system  operates about 
7.6 million miles annually on 32 routes. Service is available 365 days per year. The span of 
service is 4:30 a.m. to midnight on weekdays; 4:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. on Saturdays; and 7:00 
a.m. to 7:30 p.m. on Sundays and Holidays. MATAPlus Pa ratransit service for individuals 
with disabilities operates in the same areas and the same times as Fixed Route service.  
Paratransit service runs about 1.7 million miles per year. MATA’s Trolley shuttle service 
operates along seven miles of track in down town and midtown  Memphis . The span of service 
is about the same as the Fixed Route system with slightly later service on Friday and MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
17 
 Saturday nights. The lines serve numerous restaurants, retail stores , and attractions 
throughout downtown.  
MATA uses Genfare  Inc. (GFI) software for its current fare box systems 
(http://www.genfare.com/ ). The last software update that MATA installed was 2008. MATA 
has been using CENTSaBILL fare collection hardware for over 25 years. The c urrent system 
is a non -validated system, which means it accepts bills but cannot distinguish between 
different bills. T he fare box system accepts cash, exact change only, and will not make 
change . In 2000 it was upgraded with the Ticket Reader/ Issue Machi ne (TRiM), and is now 
equipped with a magnetic swipe pass reader that allows riders to purchase and use one day, 
three  day, weekly , and monthly passes.  
d. Shared -use mobility services:  
Zipcar offers car -sharing services in Memphis, serving downtown, Rhodes College and the 
adjacent neighborhood, and Memphis International Airport. Zipcar has nine cars as of  
February 2016 and will expand  to 20 cars by March  2016 . The City of Memphis supports car 
sharing services by providing  on-street reserved parking spaces.  
 
Explore Bike Share  has raised private funds to  pursu e the local implementation of bikeshare 
with coordination from the City of Memphis ( http://www.explorebikeshare.com/ ). The 
organization is on track to have a public bikeshare system fully operational in 2016  that will 
feature 60 stations and 600 bikes . The University of Memphis offers a bike -sharing system 
for its students.  
Transportation network companies Uber and Lyft are both in service in Memphis.   Memphis’ 
partner TransLoc will launch its transit partnership with Uber in February 2016, one of two 
pilot markets nationwide.  
d.      Information and communication technology (ICT)  
 
The City of Memphis is nearing completion of an ICT/ITS Signal System P roject (SSP) 
interconnecting 439 Traffic Signals and 188 system detectors. The SSP network allows staff 
to remotely communicate with interconnected traffic signals to monitor, diagnose, and 
maintain local traffic controller operations from the City Hall Tr affic Management Center 
(TMC). The SSP network also allows operations staff to coordinate signal timing to improve 
travel time and coordinate the traffic flow while traveling major routes in Memphis.  
 
We have deployed sixty -six of the SSP detectors, which track Bluetooth signals and MAC 
addresses in smart phones, headsets, music players, and many newer cars from point -to-
point. This initial deployment allows the City to determine travel times, speeds, o rigin and 
destinations within the Bluetooth network, route patterns, and trip lengths. Real -time data 
collected allows seeing changes in travel speeds (indicating an incident). Data on average MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
18 
 travel speed, travel time, and Origin/Destination trends will b e shared with the public, 
through our open data portal.  
 
MATA is part of a pilot project in partnership with Trans Loc and Uber to integrate Uber and 
transit services. The TransL oc system tracks vehicles in real time from GPS data and 
provides arrival predictions and transit information on the web through an open API, and 
with the Rider app on Android and IO S devices free of charge. TransL oc also offers the 
option for transit agencies to access anonymized origin and destination data, although this 
servi ce has not yet been utilized by MATA due to cost. The app also allows users to set alerts 
to let them know when a bus is arriving, and allows transit operators to post announcements 
to notify users about delays or other changes in service.  
e.        Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) including transportation management centers 
and field equipment:  
City of Memphis Division of Engineering is in the later stages of a  120 mile fiber optic 
ITS/Signal System Project, which will, interconnect approximatel y 439 Traffic Signals and 
188 system detectors. This ITS network will allow staff to remotely communicate with the 
interconnected traffic signals to monitor, diagnose, and maintain local traffic controller 
operations from the City Hall Traffic Management C enter (TMC). This network also allows 
city staff to coordinate the signal timing on several corridors to improve travel time and 
reduce the number of stops experienced when traveling on major routes.  
 
Of the 188 system detectors, 122 count stations that al low the remote monitoring of speed 
and traffic volume throughout the system. This data is used to coordinate traffic flow and 
signal timing efforts. The remaining 66 detectors gather the Bluetooth signal and MAC 
addresses as persons and vehicles travel thr oughout the City.  The City can match the MAC 
addresses with those detected at other locations to determine travel times, speeds, origin and 
destinations, route patterns, and trip lengths. This information is reported “real time” and 
provides the City visi bility into changing travel speeds (indicating an incident). The 
statistical data is then stored for future analysis and to ensure privacy the unique MAC and 
Bluetooth addresses are discarded. No personal data is collected or stored. There are a 
multitude of uses for this information.  
 
The City is currently designing a CCTV camera project that will install PTZ (Pan, Tilt, 
Zoom) cameras at approximately 50 locations throughout the city. This will allow city staff 
to remotely view live traffic conditions from  the TMC along major corridors like Poplar 
Ave., Germantown Pkwy, and Lamar Ave. The City of Memphis will eventually be able to 
share the live video feeds with the public and the media. The number of cameras will be 
expanded over time.  
 MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
19 
 Subject to availab le funding, Memphis is considering installation of Dynamic Message Signs 
at various locations throughout the city to post the current travel time from point -to-point. 
Once complete, the fiber optic network will expand to 150 miles and interconnect 
approxim ately 511 traffic signals, approximately 70% of all traffic signals in the city. This 
fiber network serves as the backbone for all future ITS initiatives.  
 
MATA ITS  
Xerox provides  MATA’s current ITS system ( https://www.xerox.com/en -
us/services/transportation -solutions/public -transport -management ), which includes the 
following components:  
 Radio System  
 Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD)/Automatic Vehicle Locator (AVL)  
 Automatic Passenger Counters (APC)  
 Automatic Vehicle Annunciation (AVA)  
 Automatic Vehicle Health Monitoring (AVM)  
 On-Board Security Cameras  
 Customer Information Signs  
The Xerox system transfers  its scheduling data from the Trapeze system. Further, MATA has 
worked with City of Memphis E ngineer ing to give buses traffic signal priority on Poplar 
Avenue, and portions of Bellevue Blvd. and Elvis Presley Blvd., three of the city’s most 
heavily used tr ansit corridors .  All of MATA’s fixed -route buses are equipped with the latest 
Global Positioning System (GPS) based transit priority emitters from Global Traffic 
Technology.  
e. Smart Grid Infrastructure including electric vehicle charging infrastructure:  
 
The Smart Grid is generally defined as a modernized electrical grid that uses information and 
communications technology to gather and act on information in an automated fashion to 
improve the efficiency, reliability, economics, and sustainability of the prod uction and 
distribution of electricity.  Memphis Light Gas and Water (MLGW) is currently converting 
residential customers to Smart Meters, allowing ratepayers to monitor time of use and adjust 
household energy consumption. MLGW is expanding use of electric  circuits connected via 
automated distribution switches. These circuits will connect different neighborhoods, 
communities, and transportation systems and enable MLGW to manage power distribution to 
meet local needs and better respond to demand and outages.  Twelve electric vehicle charging 
stations serve Memphis and Shelby County.  
9. Define the data your city currently collects.  
The City of Memphis’ Travel Time system currently collects and stores MAC (Media Access 
Control) address match information for all de vice pairs and routes for a minimum of 12 weeks. A MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
20 
 match would be one MAC address being detected by one device and then also by another paired 
device within a reasonable time frame that provides information on the actual speed and travel 
time for that part icular MAC. City Staff is able to access this information by running speed and 
travel time reports for individual pairs and/or routes.  
 
Currently, city staff run speed and travel time reports for major corridors periodically, but not on 
any strategic sche dule due to staffing limitations. The City of Memphis initially invested in this 
travel time system to provide information on performance measures associated with newly 
implemented signal timing plans on CMAQ projects. This information is vital to document  
potential air quality improvements.  
 
The initial data collection process involved collecting pre -improvement and post -improvement 
data. Once the system was in place data was collected to document how our transportation 
system was functioning under existing conditions. A baseline was established for comparison 
once the newly installed timing plans were in place. After the improvements were in place and 
the new timing implemente d, reports were run to compare and document improvement. During 
this period reports were run along major routes monthly to track any trends.  
 
Since the pre -improvement and post -improvement reports were documented, reports have been 
run as needed (i.e. whe n additional timing changes are implemented or when we receive 
complaints from the public on system performance). Ideally reports would be run and data 
gathered for all pairs and routes on a monthly cycle, but staffing challenges makes this difficult. 
The system as it currently stands can easily do this, but staff is needed to define the report 
parameters and run the reports. The system also allows running origin and destination reports, 
which can give vital information for transportation planning purposes.  City staff currently runs 
O/D reports as needed. The system is also able to provide information on travel time reliability, 
which is a tool to document variability in average travel time and congestion. With proper 
staffing or partner assistance, this inf ormation can be easily shared with the public to equip 
travelers with valuable information.  The Smart City Challenge could make it possible to gather 
this critically valuable data on a more systematic basis.  
 
Data that MATA collects:  
MATA reports information to the National Transit Database (NTD) about funding sources, 
ridership, and amount of service provided for fixed route, direct service (MATAplus), and rail as 
is required by FTA for all transit agencies in the U.S.  MATA also reports monthly p erformance 
measures to MATA’s Board of Commissioners and also reports on monthly ridership and On 
Time Performance to the City of Memphis.  
Using Xerox, Trapeze and other systems, MATA collects and tracks a variety of data, including 
but not limited to , On-Time Performance, Passenger Boardings, Vehicle Miles Traveled, fuel MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
21 
 usage, vehicle hours, road calls, customer service call wait times, number of complaints, 
accidents and preventable accidents. MATA uses this data identify trouble areas where 
performance  can be improved, as well as for planning and scheduling routes that better fit 
customer demand.  
The University of Memphis will become the central repository for transportation data.  The 
University  will gather , collect, store , and disseminate the collecte d data to entities and 
organizations that need the data.  The collected data could include data from the City  of 
Memphis’  signaling infrastructure, location of potholes, street cuts, etc., service work completed 
by the City and MLGW which impact th e transpo rtation infrastructure as wells  MATA route and 
ridership data.    
Through the centralized management of this data, Memphis will be able to ensure equitable 
access to the gathered information.  Partners  will enter into Memorandums of Understandings 
(MOUs) whi ch outline the datasets, frequency of data updates, and service level agreements 
surrounding the collection and dissemination of the data.  
 
10. Describe your approach for using existing standards, architectures, and certification processes 
for ITS and connected vehicle based technologies and plans for documenting experiences and 
cooperating with architecture and standards developers to improve the quality of these 
products based on lessons learned in deployment.  
The Memphis MPO is responsible for mainta ining the Regional ITS Architecture which covers 
the four county, two State MPO area including  the City of Memphis. The Regional ITS 
Architecture provides a framework for implementing ITS projects, encourages interoperability 
and resource sharing among age ncies, identifies applicable standards to apply to projects, and 
allows for cohesive long -range planning among regional stakeholders. ITS architectures allow 
local stakeholders including the City of Memphis to plan for what they want their system to look 
like in the long -term and then break out the system into smaller pieces that can be implemented 
as funding permits.  
Within the Memphis Urban Area there have been several ITS initiatives and deployments 
throughout the Region. These programs have come from mu ltiple agencies and cover multiple 
transportation modes as well. Some of the larger ITS initiatives and deployments that exist or are 
underway in the Memphis Urban Area are listed below.  
 TDOT SmartWay Program – This freeway management program is continuing  to evolve 
and grow in the Memphis Urban Area and includes CCTV cameras, Dynamic Message 
Signs (DMS), and vehicle detectors. The communications for the system are handled 
through a fiber optic backbone with a wireless connection.  
 
 TDOT HELP – The TDOT HELP  program has been in operation in the Memphis Urban 
Area since July 1999. The HELP program trucks patrol I -40, I -55, I -240, Sam Cooper MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
22 
 Boulevard, and portions of SR -385, assisting motorists with flat tire changes, fuel, and 
minor vehicle repairs. The HELP program also provides assistance to the local police and 
State Highway Patrol with the management of incidents by providing traffic control and 
advance warning to motorists.  
 
 511 Traveler Information Number – TDOT currently operates a statewide traveler 
information number that provides real -time traveler information throughout the state. 
Information is put into 511 through the TDOT Statewide Information for Travelers 
(SWIFT) sy stem. 511 information can also be accessed through the TDOT SmartWay 
website ( http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/tdotsmartway/ ) which includes a subscription for 
Rich Site Summary (RSS) feeds, TDOT SmartWa y App, and several social media sites 
such as Twitter and Facebook . 
 
 City of Memphis Traffic Operations Center (TOC) – The City of Memphis has an 
existing signal system that supports real time monitoring and control of traffic signals.  
From the TOC and th e Signal Maintenance facility, the City has the capability to 
implement traffic signal timing plans, monitor traffic conditions and the operations of the 
signals, and to monitor the status of equipment. The City of Memphis also provides 
signal maintenance to all traffic signals within Shelby County. Memphis plans to begin 
the installation of CCTV cameras in the future as funding becomes available.  
 
 Shelby County Congestion Management Program (CMP) - The CMP is a countywide 
effort that includes the City of B artlett, City of Germantown, City Lakeland, City of 
Memphis, City of Millington, Town of Arlington, Town of Collierville, and 
unincorporated areas of Shelby County. This initiative includes installing new traffic 
signals in addition to upgrading, replacing , retiming, and connecting various traffic 
signals and signal components throughout the county. ITS elements that will be installed 
include video detection, fiber optic cable, and emergency vehicle preemption.  
 
 MATA ITS – MATA has developed an extensive ITS program that includes automated 
vehicle location (AVL) on fixed -route buses and trolleys and paratransit vehicles, 
automated passenger counting that can distinguish a person from an inanimate object, 
onboard security cameras, transit signal priority fo r certain routes, and automated transit 
fleet maintenance monitoring. Additionally, MATA provides riders with next bus arrival 
DMS at all trolley stations and real -time bus location information on the MATA website 
and the TransLoc Rider app.  
Implementation  of the ITS Architecture requires agreement among stakeholders to share 
information needed to provide the ITS services. The following is the list of existing agreements 
in the MPO region between City of Memphis and other entities:  MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
23 
  Memorandum of Understandi ng between the City of Memphis and the City of 
Germantown regarding traffic signal ITS coordination;  
 
 Agreement developed by TDOT for live CCTV video access for governmental agency 
users ; 
 
 Agreement developed by TDOT for live CCTV video access for private entity users.  
 
11. Provide measurable goals and objectives for your vision and describe your approach for 
monitoring the impact of the demonstration on mobility, safety, efficiency, sustainability, and 
climate change.  
Unemployment rates have fallen across the nation and Memphis is no exception. As the 
economy has improved, employers are increasingly seeking workers and pay rates are rising in 
response to market conditions. Yet many Memphis neighborhoods continue to have  high rates of 
poverty and unemployment. Labor markets and economic development efforts suffer from the 
continuing mismatch between job opportunities and workers from  poor neighborhoods who lack  
access to adequate and affordable public transportation . These needs will be addressed in the 
demonstration area by providing flexible on demand service with public and private alternatives. 
Demonstration strategies  will include using connected  vehicles to move people in the target area 
to transit stations and other collections points using various modes of transit, hybrid  and electric 
vehicle s, and alternative fuels  where possible .  
Goal 1 . Connect residents from high poverty neighborhoods to th e employment opportunities 
concentrated in the demonstration area in a consistent, timely, safe, and environmentally friendly 
manner using modes other than single occupancy vehicle.    
Moving people to jobs consistently, quickly, effectively , and efficientl y is one key to reducing 
poverty and creating employment and income opportunities for the people most in need. Getting 
people to work on time consistently and having dependable public transportation is crucial to  
sustaining long -term employment relationshi ps between people in need of jobs and employers in 
need of workers.  
Our demonstration  project will use smart technology applications to reduce many of the 
transportation barriers in the targeted labor market. Memphis has a large area of concentrated 
pover ty surrounding the largest concentration of industrial, distribution , and transportation 
employers in the city. Yet the match between jobs and workers is constrained in part by the lack 
of transportation and the congestion found throughout the area. Traffi c corridors in the area 
move both freight and employees and are heavily congested , especially at peak periods when 
shipments and shift changes occur. The use of a multimodal approach that includes both bik ing, 
walking,  and private/public transit partnership initiatives is designed to shift employee traffic 
increasingly to highly flexible and responsive combinations of private and public transit 
alternatives that mix traditional public transit with new transportation mod es.  MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
24 
 Objectives for Goal 1:  
Improve access to jobs by low -income participants in the study area by 5% (share of jobs 
in transit area reachable via transit within 90 minutes)  
Increase transit ridership in the study area by 10%  
Improve transit passengers per  hour on selected routes that serve the study area by 5%  
Improve paratransit passengers per hour within the study area by 10%  
Increase bicycle usage by 5%  
Increase protected bicycle lanes by 15%  
Improve pedestrian sidewalks, paths, and connectivity by 20%  
Reduce bicycle accidents in the study area by 10%  
Increase walking trips by 5%  
Reduce pedestrian accidents in the study area by 20%  
Reduce freight traffic delay in selected corridors within the study area such as Lamar and 
Winchester by 5%  
Outcome Measure s for Goal 1:  
 
Achieve 28 percent increase of commuters using transit, walking, and bicycling to work 
within the study area by 2020.   The increase in transit ridership can be measured using 
MATA’s automatic passenger counters, origin -destination data from  TransLoc 
application users, and private cab company records and Uber customer information.  
Cycling data can be obtained from bike  share usage records and counters installed along 
selected routes. Estimates for increase walking trips may be inferred based  on increases 
in walking and biking trips and estimates.  
 
Improve the model public transit system designed to serve the target area  by expanding 
the use of transit signal priority in the study area in the most congested corridors such as 
Winchester Avenue, Elvis Presley Blvd., and Lamar Avenue . Using the technology 
available with traffic signal priority, transit, general traffic, and freight movements can be 
monitored and travel -time improvements or delay can be measured on a corridor -by-
corridor basis. The resulting data can be used to quantify the objectives outlined in Goal 1 
above and measurable outcomes will be reported for each o f the objectives listed for Goal 
1.  MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
25 
 Upgrades will include conversion of MATA bus fare boxes to accept RFID cards or other 
smart devices usable for additional modes of transport including bike share, ride share, 
taxi, transportation network providers, and perhaps access to other services such as 
libraries, museums, and  other cultural assets.  
MATA using o pen API will allow developers access to software applications to help 
establish common open transit API that can be used by any transit agency . 
 
Increase the network and responsiveness of MATA using smart technology and logistics 
models provided by FedEx. FedEx is one of the world’s foremost logistics and 
distribution companies and is headquartered in Memphis. Using logistics models to locate 
trans it collection points, streamline the network of private/public transportation providers 
and create collection and distribution networks would initiate the generation of replicable 
models for the entire city of Memphis and other cities . The process metrics will include 
(a) developing the models that expand the coverage and usage of the existing matrix of 
public and private transportation alternatives; (b) increasing ridership to reduce time lost 
in travel  and the cost of get ting to work for area residents;  and (c) generate partnerships 
between neighborhoods and employers to reduce congestion and travel times  along area 
transit corridors.  
 
New public -private partnerships will be formed with area employers, MATA, University 
of Memphis, City of Memphis, FedEx, a nd others to develop, test, and evaluate strategies 
deployed to get more people to work in the target area at all times.  
Transportation Management Associations will be formed to move people and goods 
within the employer campuses and around the demonstrati on area using connected, 
automated vehicles.   
The City of Memphis will continue building out and expanding the fiber optic network 
and test a concentration of ITS initiatives like traffic signalization, infrastructure for 
connected vehicles, CCTV  cameras, and dynamic message signs in the demonstration 
area.   
Increase  protected  bike and pedestrian infrastructure in  the demonstration  area.   
Increasing the miles of protected bike and pedestrian infrastructure  that link s employers 
to surrounding neig hborhoods will increase safety, and reduce congestion , pollution , and 
the cost of transportation . Bike ridership and the reduction in the number of car trips and 
miles estimated can be measured for each employer. More employees biking and walking  
decrease s the congestion and generate s positive benefits for neighborhoods, employers 
and the community.  
Goal 2 . Memphis is a freight -centric community and areas of the city are often paralyzed with 
congestion and accompan ying safety problems caused by extremely hi gh truck volumes. 
Advanced sensor technologies, using the existing sensor networks in place as a basis, will be 
employed to facilitate the movement of trucks thr oughout  the region and to explore the MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
26 
 development of an optimal system of moving freight from t he area intermodal rail yards to the 
warehouse/distribution centers , and especially the ‘last mile’ deliveries in the urban core. The 
use of these  proposed  technologies will streamline the supply chain, reduce congestion, enhance 
air quality, and improve safety and reliability. Peak period congestion brings traffic along Lamar 
Avenue, the primary arterial road through the area and an urban extension of Inter state 22 in 
Mississippi, to a standstill for multiple periods each day. The congestion limits economic 
development, constrains the expansion of the Aerotropolis since the airport is located in the same 
target area and prevents local residents from getting to and from work. Measureable goals and 
objectives and the data items to be monitored include the following pr ocess and outcome 
measurements.  
Objectives for Goal 2 : 
Improve freight movement through selected corridors such as Lamar Avenue (I -22) 
within the study area by 5%  
Reduce delay of freight and traffic at high volume intersections such as Lamar and 
Winchester and Lamar and Shelby Drive by 5%  
Reduce freight greenhouse gas emissions by 10%  
Reduce freight related accidents within the study by 5%  
Outcome Measure for Goal 2 : 
Increase the use of sensor technology to enhance freight movement along Lamar Avenue 
and in the Aerotropolis area surrounding Memphis International Airport.  
This technology will be focused on optimizing the drayage movement from intermodal 
rail yards to warehouse/distribution centers  and improv ing delivery systems in the urban 
area.  
Measuring the adoption of alternative freight movement technologies that expedite the 
movement of freight from rail yards and between employers will generate reductions in 
congestion and pollution. The adoption rate, partnership agreements between employers 
and shippers, freight movements, traffic reductions and travel time reductions can be 
measured and will generate cost saving estimates. Congestion reductions will allow  
employers to expand employment and income opportunities in the area.  
Similar to Goal 1, measurable outcomes will be developed and reported for each of the 
objectives listed above for Goal 2.    
Outcome Measurement for both Goals 1 and 2: 
Return on the Investment  MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
27 
 Efficiency will be measured in terms of the return on investment via the Value of Travel 
Time Savings (VTTS) brought about by reducing the average wait time (headways) for 
transportation in demonstration area.  Using data deriv ed from the U.S. Department of 
Transportation Values of Time Savings analysis, the VTTS in terms of cost of waiting for 
transportation is valued at $25.00 per person per hour (see Revised Departmental 
Guidance on Valuation of Travel Time in Economic Analys is, 2015, at 
http://ostpxweb.dot.gov/policy/reports.htm ).  
 MATA is the largest transit agency in the State of Tennessee, transporting some 
40,000 riders every day throughout Memphis and the surr ounding areas.  
 
 MATA routes generally operate for 13 hours per day (roughly 6:00 am to 7:00 pm) 
with 30 or 60 - minute headways.  
 
o Headway is a measurement of the distance or time between vehicles in a 
transit system.  
o Average waiting time for the next bus could be around 45 minutes (average).  
o Estimated system -wide cost of waiting for transportation would is 
approximately $273,750,000 a year.  
o A 10.0% reduction in headways would result in a system -wide savings of 
$27,375,000 per year.  
o MATA riders would experience significant quality of life improvements by 
recapturing this headway time, allowing more time for family, home 
responsibilities, resting, or working a second job.  
 
 Return on Investment (ROI).  Specifically the reduction in headways for the 
demonstration area will be measured to determine the VTTS.  The demonstration 
VTTS total will be compared with total grant costs to generate a Return On 
Investment.

 12. Provide evidence that establishes your capacity to take on a project of this magnitude, 
including executive commitment, workforce capacity, degree of infrastructu re readiness, 
data and performance management capabilities.  
The City of Memphis is confident in its ability to  implement and execute our proposed Smart 
City Challenge demonstration, which was developed through collaboration and consultation with 
other government agencies, private enterprise, local philanthropic institutions, and a local 
university. In addition to the previously stated commitment from executive leadership, the

13. Describe any opportunities to leverage Federal resources through cost share, in -kind 
donations, and partnering.  
In addition to the Memphis Smart City Transportat ion Alliance providing resources such as 
necessary staff, consultants, technology, and general office needs, v arious activities are 
underway in Memphis that the Smart City Challenge will leverage, most led by members of the 
Alliance.  
 
Local philanthropy h as funded a Transportation Mobility Project Manager housed with Innovate 
Memphis charged with analyzing issues and developing innovative solutions around local 
transportation options  including development of sustainable funding models .  
 
Explore Bike Share has raised millions of private dollars to launch of a 60 station, 600 bike 
system which will be installed in 2016.  
 
Transport ation issues are a focus area of the Greater Memphis Chamber’s Chairman’s Circle , a 
leadership body created to e ngage Memphis business leaders on a variety of issues that affect 
Memphis and the Mid -South.   
 
One of FedEx Cares ’ (the charitable arm of FedEx) five pillars of strategic investment to 
strengthen communities  is Sustainable Transportation: Developing solutions that connect the 
world responsibly and resourcefully.  MEMPHIS USDOT  SMART CITY CHALLENGE  
29 
 The University of Memphis is home to the Intermodal Freight Transportation Institute, a 
nationally recognized leader in linking people to solutions in freight and logistics through 
research, e ducation , and technology transfer activities.  
Additionally, the Smart City Challenge will align with many recent federal investments. The 
City of Memphis ITS infras tructure was federally funded. Total obligated construction funding 
of $30 Million, $19.24 Million of CMAQ ,$10.76 Million of STP. An additional $7.9 Million is 
being invested in the coordinated signal system through the Shelby County Congestion 
Management Program (SCCMP, CMAQ funded). Total investment = $37.9 Million.  
  
The Master Plan for Airp ort City (Aerotropolis) was funded by a $2.5  million  HUD  Sustainable 
Communities  Community Challenge Grant.   
 
Shelby County was recently announced as one of 13 winners of HUD’s National Disaster 
Resilience Competition, securing $60.4 million, including fu nds for resilient redevelopment of a 
neighborhood on the western edge of the target area and a regional resilience plan that has 
significant impact on the target area.  
Sources of Federal Funding that MATA can leverage include New Starts, Congestion Mitigat ion  
Air Quality (CMAQ) grant, TIGER, and STP funds  in addition to FTA formula funds.  
MATA has received roughly $5.8 million per year in discretionary grants from 2000 to 2015.  
These include:  
 $54 million New Starts for Madison Avenue Rail Line  
 $12 millio n in FTA capital funds for construction of the Airways Transit Center  
 $1 million in FTA Alternatives Analysis planning funds  
 $6.3 million CMAQ for new routes, park and rides, and equipment  
Other competitive federal transit grants include bus replacement a nd rehabilitation funds (FTA 
Section 5339); capital investment, technical assistance, and training grants (FAST Act Section 
3016, adopted December 2015); and possible re -appropriation of unspent highway funds under 
the “Use It or Lose It” provision.  
MATA is also eligible to receive Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Surface 
Transportation Program (STP, soon to be renamed Surface Transportation Block Group) funds 
through the Memphis Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO). Memphis MPO has divided 
STP fu nds into major roads and repaving, signals, bridge repair, and bicycle/pedestrian projects. 
MATA can apply for STP funding for major capital projects, including vehicles.
